The tool consists of information volunteered by participating open infrastructure services providers. While we do our best to verify all information submitted by participating providers, we cannot and do not guarantee the validity or accuracy of any information presented in the Infra Finder tool. Also, please be aware that the Infra Finder is provided for informational purposes only, and the inclusion of a particular open infrastructure service or provider in the Infra Finder does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of that service or provider by IOI. We encourage you to do your own due diligence before purchasing any services that are described in the Infra Finder."
