The focus of the platform is on making multimodal long-form content (as well as simpler ebooks) as accessible, discoverable, and durable as possible. Because of its focus on long-term stewardship, the main Fulcrum service is a hosted one, based at the University of Michigan Library. While the code is all open source, the value of the platform lies in how embedded it is in research library infrastructure. The platform is heavily standards-based and connects with a variety of authoring, annotation, and editing tools.

<p><b>Durability:</b> Working with other platforms to ensure that the types of multimodal publications that are facilitated by services such as Fulcrum can be preserved in terms of their functionality as well as content is a priority, as the fragility of the digital cultural record and the mismatch between authors expectations of longevity and the reality of the stewardship promise that libraries and publishers are making is of concern.</p>","Unknown","","unknown","","Implemented/available","https://www.fulcrum.org/terms/","available","https://github.com/mlibrary/heliotrope","Implemented/available","","Unknown","","Implemented/available","https://www.lib.umich.edu/about-us/about-library/diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility","In progress","","Implemented/available","https://www.fulcrum.org/about/","in_progress","","Implemented/available","https://www.fulcrum.org/accessibility/","Implemented/available","https://www.fulcrum.org/partner-with-us/","Implemented/available","https://www.fulcrum.org/privacy/","In progress","","Implemented/available","https://mpub.atlassian.net/l/cp/XXJc1NPw","Implemented/available","https://www.fulcrum.org/accessibility/","","","","","","false","Publishing system","","","Fulcrum uses the It Takes a Village audit tool from Lyrasis to check in regularly on its commitments to the community: <a href=""https://itav.lyrasis.org/"" target=""_blank"">https://itav.lyrasis.org/</a>.

The Foundation is governed by a Supervisory Board and an Advisory Board.</p>","The OAPEN Library was developed as a 30-month targeted project co-funded by the EU in its eContentplus-program (2008-2010). The goal of the project was to build a platform for peer-reviewed open access academic books and to explore publication and business models for open book publishing. After the close of the project, OAPEN continued its activities as a not-for-profit and independent foundation (a Stichting - cannot be sold or acquired by law).

Maintaining and developing this core part of the infrastructure to accommodate the needs of publishers and libraries is an increasingly more challenging task as more and more books are sent to the OAPEN Library and the demands among institutions increase. Furthermore, as research funders develop OA book policies OAPEN's service provision to the funders also needs developing.</p> 

<p>In short, funding will help the maintenance of existing and the development of new open services as required by libraries and funders, enabling seamless access to thousands of scholarly books for millions of readers worldwide. Additionally, funding will enable OAPEN to pursue equity for publishers worldwide by providing global distribution services to any publisher who fullfills the basic requirements of peer review and open access. OAPEN is proactively reaching out to publishers in all regions of the world to make them aware of these possibilities.</p>","Implemented/available","https://oapen.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/f3b35fca50b04b03a7687e43322ba538.pdf","unknown","","Considering","","in_progress","","Implemented/available","","Implemented/available","","Implemented/available","https://oapen.hypotheses.org/524","Implemented/available","https://oapen.org/oapen/2972481-annual-reports","Implemented/available","https://www.oapen.org/oapen/1891940-organisation","available","https://www.oapen.org/librarians/15635975-metadata","Implemented/available","https://www.oapen.org/librarians/15635975-metadata","Implemented/available","https://oapen.org/librarians/15963583-support-oapen-libraries","Implemented/available","https://oapen.org/oapen/8472896-privacy-statement","In progress","","Implemented/available","https://www.oapen.org/publishers/11625552-upload-instructions","Implemented/available","https://oapen.org/oapen/5664198-accessibility","","","","","","false","Discovery system | Publishing system","","","Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructure, POSI - <a href=""https://oapen.hypotheses.org/524"" target=""_blank"">https://oapen.hypotheses.org/524</a>","Code | Funds | Working / Interest Groups","","","Formal","Advisory board or steering committee","","Non-profit organization","","","","","Other","","","","Not applicable","Actual system proven in operational environment","Actively Maintained","","","","See <a href=""https://www.oapen.org/librarians/13678551-services-libraries"" target=""_blank"">https://www.oapen.org/librarians/13678551-services-libraries</a>

While DSpace shares some feature overlap with content management systems and document management systems, the DSpace repository software serves a specific need as a digital archives system, focused on the long-term storage, access and preservation of digital content thus making DSpace the software of choice for academic, non-profit, and commercial organizations building open digital repositories. It is free and easy to install “out of the box” and completely customizable to fit the needs of any organization.","<p>The major goal achieved in 2023 was the release of DSpace 7.6 release, the final 7.x release to include new features. The 7.x platform will now move into maintenance mode as we focus on 8.0.</p>

<p>The release was made possible by generous financial contributions and nearly 2000 hours of development. </p>

<p>In 2023, DSpace also organised 3 different Q&A online meetings, attended by hundreds of global users who were able to find the answers they were looking for about the latest releases. In addition to that, DSpace organised a hybrid in-person/online workshop for the Spanish-speaking community, which has already been viewed by over 2000 people.</p>","We will create superior open source software by harnessing the skills of an active developer community, the energy and insights of engaged and active users, and the financial support of project members and registered service providers.","<p><a href=""https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSPACE/Project+Governance"" target=""_blank"">DSpace governance</a> is based on a representative, community-based membership model incrementally rewarding members who have made the greatest commitments to the project.

Following the first user group meeting in March 2004, a group of interested institutions formed the DSpace Federation which determined the governance of future software development by adopting the Apache Foundation's community development model as well as establishing the DSpace Committer Group. In July 2007 as the DSpace user community grew larger, HP and MIT jointly formed the DSpace Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that provided leadership and support. In May 2009 collaboration on related projects and growing synergies between the DSpace Foundation and the Fedora Commons organization led to the joining of the two organizations to pursue their common mission in a not-for-profit called DuraSpace. DuraSpace and Lyrasis merged in July 2019. Currently, the DSpace software and user community receives leadership and guidance from Lyrasis as the Organizational Home. The community work and maintenance of the software is lead by Governance and the DSpace working groups.","DSpace software is financially supported by the community: membership dues, certified partners and service providers, and various fundraising efforts. Current fundraising campaigns are the DSpace Development Fund (DDF) and the Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services (SCOSS).

<p>Following an initial meeting of key stakeholders in 2018, and throughout 2020, OASPA ran the foundational work as a project, with the aim of preparing the groundwork for the OA Switchboard to go live as an operational solution. It delivered a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and a proposal for a sustainable governance and funding model.</p>

<p>Following, in October 2020, Stichting (‘foundation’) OA Switchboard was founded. It consists of both a mission-driven community and a practical tool, currently supporting two use cases. The technical solution is a central metadata exchange hub, that provides a standardised messaging protocol and shared infrastructure. It is built by and for the people who use it, is leveraged with existing PIDs, and has been live since 1 January 2021.

We charge fees for development and maintenance of the infrastructure, and for participants to exchange information and communicate. Pricing is transparent and we keep fees as low as possible to offer an affordable solution.
We can keep OA Switchboard participants’ fees low, because we’re open source, tightly managed for costs, and the load is shared between funders, institutions and publishers. There is an annual fixed (tiered) subscription fee.</p>

<p>Similar to how open access research is research that has been licensed to be freely shared, read, cited and more, without restrictions or fees, FOSS is licensed to be freely shared, installed, and modified. More specifically, PKP employs the General Public License V3 for its FOSS and recommends that those using the software apply a CC BY 4.0 license to their open access publications.</p>

<p>The congruence in spirit and license that PKP has achieved between FOSS and open access has worked well in assisting the academic community in taking charge of scholarly publishing in the digital era. The resulting software has led to publishers, librarians, and scholars publishing millions of peer-reviewed articles and books around the world. It has also given rise to a new generation of FOSS preprint servers.</p>

<p>Building FOSS platforms leads to a distributed model of local installations that can develop regional technical capacities on a global scale. It encourages code contributions from among users, especially in the form of FOSS plugins for the platforms. It also facilitates users sharing translations of the software. PKP systems operate in more than 30 languages, while publishing research in 60 languages. In this way, FOSS reflects a spirit of cooperation and collaboration that underlies the spread of a more open science.</p>

<p>Open source + open access is also giving rise to more equitable forms of scholarly publishing. The best example of this is the OA diamond journal phenomenon, in which neither authors nor readers are charged for open access to the journal’s content. In 2021, the OA Diamond Journals Study led by Arianna Bercerril found that 60 percent of these publishing diamonds are using OJS, while they estimate that there may be as many as 29,000 OA diamond journals. If anything, this may be an undercount, given that in 2021 over 30,000 journals were found to be using OJS, almost entirely on diamond principles.</p>

<p>All in all, open source + open access enables PKP to bring a refreshing and expanding openness to scholarly communication infrastructure on a global scale.</p>","Code | Documentation | Education / Training | Funds | Working / Interest Groups","","","Formal","Multi-board governance","","Fiscal sponsorship (academic institution)","","Vereniging zonder winstoogmerk (VZW)","","","Program service revenue","","","","Hosting through service provider or third party","Actual system proven in operational environment","Actively Maintained","","","","","GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3","","","Creative Commons licensing is used for all PKP generated content.

Additional governance development is in progress. </p>","<p>2i2c was created by its current Steering Council, who also act as its founding partners. This group roughly came from three projects that similarly operated cloud infrastructure for interactive computing:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The Berkeley DataHub is an institution-wide JupyterHub that was led in-part by Yuvi Panda, Chris Holdgraf, Cathryn Carson, and Fernando Perez.
<li> The Syzygy project (<a href=""https://syzygy.ca"">https://syzygy.ca</a>) is a network of JupyterHubs for Canadian universities that was led in-part by Jim Colliander.
<li> The Pangeo project (<a href=""https://pangeo.io"">https://pangeo.io</a>) is a community platform for Big Data geoscience that is built on a JupyterHub and cloud computing, and is led in-part by Ryan Abernathey.
</ul>
</p>
<p>Each of these projects demonstrated considerable value for the communities it served, but it was also clear that this model was unsustainable for most other communities of practice due to difficulties in hiring for cloud engineering skills.</p>

<p>As a result, communities tended to use proprietary services that weren't aligned with the values many of us identified with (e.g., community-driven infrastructure, values-based organizations, non-profit structures, etc).</p>

<p>We created 2i2c in order to have a mission-driven and community-focused organization that could design and manage cloud infrastructure on behalf of communities of practice, but that framed the partnership as a collaboration based around shared responsibility and transparency rather than a pure ""consumer / producer relationship"". We also wanted to ensure that 2i2c would commit to making upstream contributions and support as part of its key mission, in order to avoid the extractive relationship many organizations have with open source.</p>","<p>2i2c aims to identify a self-sustaining cost recovery model with ongoing service fees for communities that it partners with in managing cloud infrastructure. We also pursue several other funding streams to advance our mission in open infrastructure for open science.</p>

<p>Below are a few areas where we are actively seeking funding.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Cloud and service costs for one or more communities that cannot afford the full price of a monthly service.
<li> Development projects to enhance open source technology that is critical for open science and education.
<li> Broader community and technical support for the key open source communities in which we participate.
<li> Organizational service development funding runway to explore and refine our model for sustainably serving infrastructure.

OpenEdition is part of the French National Plan for Open Science.","","Between 1999 and 2007 the Revues.org project was launched at the University of Avignon, and then in Marseille, at the premises of the EHESS.
Over the period 2007–2017 the project expanded at pace and gained a legal structure as a CNRS joint service unit (UMS). It was called the “Centre for Open Electronic Publishing” (Cleo) until 2017.
Since 2013 the OpenEdition project has been strengthened by funding from the Equipex programme and the internationalization of the platforms, grouped into a single OpenEdition portal.

It is also engaged in advocacy for open citations, particularly in its role as a key founding member of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC).","<ol>
<li> In 2021, we crossed the threshold of one billion citations stored ingesting data from Crossref; in 2022, we extended the collection of open citations with data from two additional sources, DataCite and PubMed; and, in 2023, expanded the availability of open citation data by adding missing citations from OpenAIRE and the Japan Link Center (JaLC).
<li>We expanded our collection besides the citation data by releasing OpenCitations Meta, a database storing and delivering bibliographic metadata for all the publications in the OpenCitations Index, including the publication’s title, type, venue (e.g. journal), volume number, issue number, page numbers, publication date, identifiers and details of the main actors involved in the document’s publication (the names of the authors, editors, and publishers).
<li>In November 2023, we launched the new ingestion workflow, to produce two comprehensive collections: OpenCitations Index and OpenCitations Meta. 
<li>As of December 2023, the OpenCitations Index contains information on 1.97 billion unique open citations.
</ol>","As a key infrastructure component for global Open Science, the mission of OpenCitations is to harvest and openly publish accurate and comprehensive metadata describing the world's academic publications and the scholarly citations that link them, and to preserve ongoing access to this information by secure archiving. We provide this information, both in human-readable form and in interoperable machine-readable Linked Open Data formats, under open licenses at zero cost and without restriction for third-party analysis and re-use.","For administrative convenience, OpenCitations is managed by the <a href=""https://openscholarlymetadata.org/"" target=""_blank"">Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata</a> at the <a href=""https://www.unibo.it/"" target=""_blank"">University of Bologna</a>. OpenCitations' governance comprises the following bodies: the Directors; the Council, comprising one delegate appointed by each OpenCitations Member; the <a href=""https://opencitations.net/about"" target=""_blank"">International Advisory Board</a> elected by the Council, to guide the future developments of OpenCitations strategically; the Management Team.","OpenCitations has formally started in 2010 as a one-year project funded by JISC (with a subsequent extension), with David Shotton as director, who at that time was working in the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford. The project was global in scope, and was designed to change the face of scientific publishing and scholarly communication, since it aimed to publish open bibliographic citation information in RDF and to make citation links as easy to traverse as Web links. The main deliverable of the project, among several outcomes, was the release of an open repository of scholarly citation data 3 described using the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies, and named the OpenCitations Corpus (OCC), which was initially populated with the citations from journal articles within the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central. At the end of 2015, after David Shotton had become a member of the Oxford e-Research Centre at the University of Oxford, Silvio Peroni of the University of Bologna joined OpenCitations as co-director and technical manager, with the aim of setting up a new instantiation of the Corpus based on a new metadata schema and employing several new technologies to automate the ingestion of fresh citation metadata from authoritative sources. Silvio Peroni is now a member of the Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies at the University of Bologna, and the current instantiation of the OCC is hosted by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Bologna. Since the beginning of July 2016 OCC has been ingesting, processing and publishing reference lists of scholarly papers available in Europe PubMed Central. Additional metadata for these citations are obtained from Crossref and (for authors) ORCID. In 2017, OpenCitations was awarded of a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for The OpenCitations Enhancement Project. The funding was used to improve the hardware and software infrastructure for handling the data and hosting all the services OpenCitations makes available. During this period, OpenCitations has developed a number of citation indexes using the data openly available in third-party bibliographic databases. The first and largest of these is COCI, the OpenCitations Index of Crossref open DOI-to-DOI citations. In 2019, OpenCitations wa awarded of another grant from the Wellcome Trust for the Open Biomedical Citations in Context Corpus project. The aim of this project is to create a new dataset containing data for each individual in-text reference, making it possible to distinguish references that are cited only once from those that are cited multiple times, to see which references are cited together (e.g. in the same sentence), to determine in which section of the article references are cited (e.g. Introduction, Methods), and, potentially, to retrieve the function of the citation. Recently, at the end of 2019, OpenCitations has been selected by the Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services (SCOSS) for their second round of crowd-funding support. They stated that OpenCitations aligns well with open science goals and is an innovative service - considering that open citation data are important to the community since they have the potential to support change in research assessment, and if successful could be a game changer by challenging established proprietary citation services. Starting in January 2020, SCOSS will invite research organizations, scholarly institutions and funders of all sizes throughout the world to contribute financially in proportion to their size and ability to sustain OpenCitations' operations over the next three years as it transitions into a global scholarly infrastructure organization with a secure financial footing. OpenCitations is currently managed by the Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata, an independent research centre within the University of Bologna. The Research Centre has an International Board drawn from leaders within the main bibliographic stakeholder communities of relevance (librarians, bibliometricians, academics, data service providers, etc.) who have shown past solid commitment to open scholarship. The statutes of the Research Centre will ensure that OpenCitations' original aim of free provision of open bibliographic and citation data, services and software is maintained, and that OpenCitations as an organization cannot in future be taken over or controlled by commercial interests, nor become involved in political, regulatory, legislative or financial lobbying of any kind.","Funding External financial support is required from the stakeholder community to support OpenCitations and enable it to expand its delivery of high-quality comprehensive open bibliographic and citation metadata. Community support is necessary to make it possible for OpenCitations to move from being a 'sustainable infrastructure' (in POSI terms) to being a financially sustained infrastructure upon which the global scholarly community can rely for open bibliographic and citation metadata for many years to come.","Implemented/available","https://opencitations.net/static/docs/bodies.pdf","unknown","","Implemented/available","http://opencitations.net/static/docs/bodies.pdf","available","https://github.com/opencitations","Considering","","Implemented/available","https://opencitations.net/static/docs/membership.pdf","Considering","","In progress","","Implemented/available","https://opencitations.net/about","available","https://opencitations.net/querying","Implemented/available","https://opencitations.net/about","No direct costs","","Implemented/available","https://opencitations.net/policy","Implemented/available","https://trello.com/b/RprHYoKL/opencitations","Implemented/available","https://opencitations.net/datasets","Implemented/available","https://opencitations.net/about","","","","","","false","Open scholarly dataset","","","OpenCitations espouses fully the founding principles of Open Science.

If a web server was queried with an ARK, it should return the resource itself or some surrogate for it, such as “a table of contents instead of a large complex document.” If a question mark was appended to the ARK, though, it should return a description—metadata—instead, which “must at minimum answer the who, what, when, and why questions concern an expression of the object.”","<p><a href=""https://arks.org/community/"" target=""_blank"">ARK Alliance</a> is a global community group that works to promote and support the ARK community.

<p>Soon, authors submitting preprints to certain platforms can request feedback from PREreview community members and Clubs using a system called COAR Notify, which will create new opportunities for authors and reviewers to connect, share insights, and work together.</p>","PREreview's mission is to bring more equity and transparency to scholarly peer review by supporting and empowering communities of researchers, particularly those at early stages of their career (ECRs) and historically excluded, to review preprints in a process that is rewarding to them.","<p>PREreview is governed by an <a href=""https://content.prereview.org/people/"" target=""_blank"">Advisory Committee</a>, and is a fiscally sponsored project of <a href=""https://www.codeforsociety.org/"" target=""_blank"">Code for Science &amp; Society</a>, a US-based 501(c)3</p>","PREreview was born in 2017 as an open science project, founded by three early-career women scientists all in volunteer capacity. From the start, we embraced a shared leadership approach, capitalizing on our diverse skills, experiences, and personalities to strengthen our team. 

Our first grant in 2018 was a $2,500 Mozilla Foundation “mini-grant” which went to supporting refreshments for a number of in-person preprint review events. 
In March 2019, Daniela Saderi transitioned to a full-time role as the project director, supported by the Mozilla Foundation as a fellow for open science. 

PREreview also became a fiscally sponsored project of the non-profit organization Code for Science and Society, firmly rooted in a non-profit model to align with our values of openness and community prioritization over commercialization. 
Initial funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation enabled the creation of the first prototype of PREreview.org. Subsequent support from the Wellcome Trust allowed us to develop a second iteration and introduce new tools for collaborative peer review.

From 2020 and 2022, we entered a collaboration with the non-profit journal eLife to support efforts to expand peer-review training to more communities. To date, we continue to partner with eLife to advance open evaluation of preprints. In 2022, a significant two-year grant from the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, in collaboration with eLife, led to the development of the best-ever third version of PREreview.org, offering accessible tools and resources while facilitating increased community engagement and input.","<p>Investing in PREreview means supporting an independent, non-for-profit organization dedicated to transforming scholarly evaluation through the lenses of openness, equity and collaboration.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 by three early-career women scientists, PREreview primarily relies on grants and has had only one full-time employee, the director, with a volunteer leadership team for the first 3 years. In 2022, thanks to investment from the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, we added three new team members who brought us to new highs. We now offer services like peer-review training workshops and collaborative review sessions to research institutions, funders, and publishers, moving from grants to a service-based model while staying true to their mission.
However, we can't fully sustain ourselves with service contracts alone. We believe we are at a turning point, with strong technology and community support. We are asking for support from organizations, governments, and others who share our values to help transform research evaluation, with a focus on marginalized groups in academia.</p>
 
<p>Such support will open up new opportunities for us to partner and build trust with like-minded organizations who are active in their communities. In the next 2-3 years, we plan to improve and scale 3 pillars that support researchers' journeys towards more open, fair, and collaborative peer review: 1) inclusive and accessible training in open review practices, 2) an authoring platform integrated with the peer-review ecosystem that supports rigorous and ethical open peer review, and 3) collaborative groups we call clubs that will allow users from diverse groups to continue building their own, decentralized communities of open peer-review practice supported by our training and platform.</p>","Unknown","","unknown","","Implemented/available","https://prereview.org/code-of-conduct","available","https://github.com/PREreview/prereview.org","Implemented/available","","Implemented/available","","Implemented/available","https://prereview.org/edi-statement","Considering","","Implemented/available","https://content.prereview.org/people","in_progress","","Implemented/available","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","In progress","https://prereview.org/trainings","Implemented/available","https://prereview.org/privacy-policy","Implemented/available","https://content.prereview.org/exciting-platform-news-for-prereview-in-2023","Implemented/available","https://prereview.org/how-to-use","Implemented/available","https://prereview.org/edia","","","","","","false","Peer review system","","","POSI evaluation in progress.","Contribute reviews | Contribute to shaping tools and resources | Education / Training | Funds | Lead and participate in collaborative peer review clubs | Participate in PREreview-facilitated live review sessions | Participate in user research design sprints | Participate in user research interviews | Request and participate in special interest Slack channels | Working / Interest Groups","","","Ad hoc","Advisory board or steering committee","","Fiscal sponsorship (non-profit)","","","","","Contributions","","","","Not applicable","Actual system proven in operational environment","Actively Maintained","","","","Airtable, Azure, CiviCRM, Cloudinary, COAR Notify Protocol, Fathom, Ghost, Google Drive, OAuth, Sciety, Slack","MIT License","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024-03-11T19:09:55Z","2024-08-21T15:42:11Z","2024-03-11T19:09:56Z","published","{""links"":[]}","{""link"":{}}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://prereview.org/code-of-conduct""}]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://github.com/PREreview/prereview.org""}]}","{""links"":[],""statement"":""\u003cp\u003eOver the course of this year we have run 6 design sprints, covering three topic areas: Rapid PREreviews, Community Features, and Search and Discovery.

<li>Fedora 6.0 was released in June 2020 and represented the largest major rewrite of the core code since Fedora 4 was released in 2014. Fedora 6.0 saw the elimination of ModeShape as a backend, and the introduction of the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) as a preservation standard within the persistence layer. This change returned Fedora to its digital preservation-focused roots, giving users back the transparency and functionality they were used to from previous versions. Fedora 6.x adoption rates are steadily climbing, and feedback from users indicates it is robust and performant.

<li>In 2020, Fedora was awarded an IMLS Grant (Fedora Migration Paths & Tools: A Pilot Project) to support development of tooling and documentation to help users migrate from Fedora 3.x to Fedora 6.x. Fedora 3 is one of the most widely used versions of the software that exists, but it is end of life, and the continued reliance on this outdated software puts the security, functionality and reliability of those repositories at risk. The grant effort created a migration pathway to help navigate the migration process in an effort to protect the content contained within those repositories. Coupled with the tooling, a Migration Toolkit was published, providing step-by-step instructions, templates, user stories, and best practices gathered from the grant pilot partners. This toolkit is maintained on the Fedora wiki <a href=""https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/FF/Fedora+Migration+Paths+and+Tools"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

<li>Fedora has a globally installed user base and recently has taken action to ensure broader representation at decision-making levels of program governance. Through intentional outreach and engagement with partners and users outside of North America, the Fedora program has grown its global geographical representation on Governance, and non-North American members now make up nearly 30% of the group. Our continued work to connect with more diverse users has resulted in significant growth in our community communication channels with over 100 new members being added to these channels in the last year.

These users representing all domains of science and engineering have registered more than 122,000 studies, created more than 616,000 projects, stored more than 18M files, publicly shared more than 9.1M of those files, and posted more than 125,000 papers. Research consumers do not need to register an account to view and download public content on OSF. The yearly consumer user base is more than 10x the size of the cumulative registered users base with >21 million unique visitors that viewed >54 million files and downloaded ~52 million files in 2022 alone.</p>

<p>OSF has two central differentiators from other tools in the marketplace supporting open science. The first is OSF’s unique, secure, open-source architecture that supports integrations with other tools and services that researchers rely on. OSF connects the phases and contents of the research lifecycle together and enables fluid public and private research management to increase efficiency and reduce time needed for re-uploading, moving, or looking for resources. The second is that OSF supports lifecycle open science. OSF can be used as a retrospective repository to share research data and other assets after the research project is completed. But, its core value proposition is that it supports the researcher from conception through completion, consumption, and re-use. By supporting the entire lifecycle, OSF makes researchers more efficient, makes their work more rigorous, and makes it easier to connect and share some or all of the history and products of the research.</p>

<p>The COS team continually engages with users and stakeholders to understand the ways collaborators, data consumers, and funders need to search and browse the corpus of public research output on OSF. Years of feedback were integrated with new user testing, which focused on discovery features that would provide the most value for researchers. Further analysis determined how users would expect the features to work and how results would be interpreted. Finally, we overlapped this feedback with other stakeholder needs, like funder programs and institutional administrators that are working with research communities to more effectively track and report research plans and results. The result of the community and stakeholder input is a new discovery solution on OSF with a suite of brand new search features, making it easier and faster to find OSF content that meets their precise needs. These same features provide unique insights for institutional administrators, funder program officers, and librarians, including more ways to find relevant funding opportunities and interdisciplinary or inter-institutional collaborations. Most critically the <a href=""https://www.cos.io/blog/new-osf-search-features-for-rapid-research-findability-and-sharing"" target=""_blank"">new discovery features</a>, in addition to the robust metadata enabled on OSF, enables researchers and research institutions to meet funder and publisher data sharing commitments.</p>","Our mission is to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research.","<p>OSF is a project of Center for Open Science, which is <a href=""https://www.cos.io/about/board"" target=""_blank"">governed by</a> a Board of Directors.</p>","The Open Science Framework was launched in 2012 as part of a graduate student project. The COS launched in 2013 with the support of the Laura and John Arnold Foundation to build and sustain OSF. <a href=""https://www.cos.io/timeline"" target=""_blank"">See history here.</a>","<p>Data-sharing policies offer the promise of advancing knowledge by increasing reproducibility and reuse of data for secondary purposes. However, that promise will not be realized if the policies are implemented poorly such that data sharing is highly burdensome, error prone, or difficult to monitor. Administrative activities are already a substantial burden on researchers, and increasingly so over time (Barham et al., 2014). Every bit of friction that can be removed from the implementation of data-sharing policies contributes to advancing knowledge by allowing current and next-generation researchers to spend their time and attention where it should be -- doing research. Addressing burden in the implementation of rigor and transparency-enhancing policies is essential for making U.S.-based researchers more competitive in a global research environment.</p>

<p>Support for infrastructure, like OSF, will enable us to address these dire needs for research by making the tools that make it possible and easy for researchers to collaborate, share, and reuse research data and outputs. And enable the research ecosystem to enact the values of quality, rigor, and reproducibility and align incentives to support researchers to adopt these practices.</p>","Implemented/available","https://osf.io/pjnse","available","https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/ember-osf-preprints/blob/develop/LICENSE","Implemented/available","https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cos.io/blob/master/TERMS_OF_USE.md","available","https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io","Implemented/available","","Implemented/available","https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cos.io/blob/master/TERMS_OF_USE.md","Implemented/available","https://www.cos.io/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-at-cos","In progress","","Implemented/available","https://www.cos.io/about/board","available","https://api.osf.io/v2/https://developer.osf.io/","Implemented/available","https://Doi.Org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CNWJ3","Implemented/available","https://www.cos.io/products/osf-preprints","Implemented/available","https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cos.io/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md","In progress","","Implemented/available","https://help.osf.io/","Implemented/available","https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019737894-FAQs#what-accessibility-standards-does-osf-adhere-to","","","","","","false","Repository service | Repository software","","","Engaged with POSI, provided feedback to continue to iterate to support additional  use cases so may become an adopter.

The JATS provides a set of XML elements and attributes for describing the textual and graphical content of journal articles as well as some non-article material such as letters, editorials, and book and product reviews.","<p>User-suggested changes are collected and discussed by the <a href=""https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/jats"" target=""_blank"">JATS Standing Committee</a> who decide on action based on NISO continuous maintenance procedures.</p>","<p>The NISO project was a continuation of the work done by NLM/NCBI, and popularized by the NLM's PubMed Central as a de facto standard for archiving and interchange of scientific open-access journals and its contents with XML. See also <a href=""https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2017/09/jats-wheres-it-going-where-has-it-been"" target=""_blank"">https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2017/09/jats-wheres-it-going-where-has-it-been</a></p>

</p>With the NISO standardization the NLM initiative has gained a wider reach, and several other repositories, such as SciELO and Redalyc, adopted the XML formatting for scientific articles.

We aim to make professional-level publishing on the web intuitive and accessible for both established presses and library/DH based publishers.

<p><strong>OAI-PMH feed:</strong> To help facilitate the inclusion of Manifold projects in library and agency collections, we are going to expose Manifold metadata via instance-specific OAI-PMH feeds.</p>

<p><strong>External authentication:</strong> We will develop and document options for integrating Manifold with external login via LDAP, Oauth, or SAML. When configured with a university’s authentication management system, students will be able to log into Manifold using their existing school credentials. This will ease one of the major barriers to using Manifold in the classroom, which currently involves the creation of a new account or authentication through third-party services like Google or Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Resources revisited:</strong> We are going to revisit how resources display in the reader and add support for additional ways of embedding resources into texts.</p>

<p><strong>Code splitting:</strong> When the Manifold client application is requested, Manifold currently returns a very large bundle that includes all code. Code splitting involves splitting this bundle into smaller bundles, which will reduce the time it takes for the initial render to take place. Reducing the bundle size will lead to improved performance, especially on low-bandwidth connections.</p>

Publications in Europe PMC are enriched with links to supporting data, citations, funding, protocols, and peer review materials. Europe PMC offers advanced tools for search, retrieval, and interaction with the scientific literature, including Grant Finder, ORCID claiming, text-mined biological annotations, and more. Europe PMC is hosted by EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). It is endorsed and supported by 37 international research funders as their dedicated open access repository.","<p><b>1. Indexing preprint peer reviews</b> </br>
Europe PMC now displays information about preprint peer reviews on the preprint page and provides a filter to search for preprints with associated reviews. Preprint review links and metadata are retrieved from Sciety and Review Commons as DocMap files and processed using an open source parser developed by the Europe PMC team. This information is also available to programmatic users via a dedicated RESTful API module.</p>
<p><b>2. Indexing new preprint servers</b></br>
Within the past year content from 7 preprint servers has been added to Europe PMC: AfricArXiv, agriRxiv, AIJR Preprints, ARPHA Preprints, EcoEvoRxiv, PaleorXiv, and Qeios preprints. This brings the number of preprint platforms indexed in Europe PMC to 32 in total, and we continue to add new providers as they become established.</p>
<p><b>3. Open source developments</b></br>
Europe PMC has committed to develop all new code as open source. Recently we have opened legacy code (<a href=""https://gitlab.ebi.ac.uk/literature-services/public-projects/textmining-annotator/-/tree/main/"" target=""_blank"">https://gitlab.ebi.ac.uk/literature-services/public-projects/textmining-annotator/-/tree/main/</a>) to aid reuse of the Europe PMC text mining tool. This enables text-mining of biological entities in content that is not available in Europe PMC. An example use case is text-mining of chemicals in life science patents by ChEMBL.</p>","To build open, full-text scientific literature resources and support innovation and discovery by engaging users, enabling contributors, and integrating related research outputs.","<p>Europe PMC is developed by the <a href=""https://www.ebi.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"">EMBL-EBI</a> (European Bioinformatics Institute), an outstation of the EMBL. Europe PMC is <a href=""https://europepmc.org/Governance"" target=""_blank"">governed by</a> an international, independent Scientific Advisory Board that advises the PI of the Europe PMC grant and the Directors of the EMBL-EBI. The Europe PMC Funders are represented by the Funder Committee.</p>","<p>The Europe PMC was originally launched as UKPMC, a UK version of PubMed Central, in 2007. UKPMC aimed to provide a stable, permanent, and free-to-access online digital archive of the full-text, peer-reviewed research publications. UKPMC formed a part of a network of PMC International (PMCI) repositories that included PubMed Central USA and PubMed Central Canada. UKPMC was established by a consortium of UK biomedical research funding bodies, including the Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council, the Department of Health, Cancer Research UK and the British Heart Foundation to enable researchers to comply with the open access policies of their funders through author manuscript submission. The partner organizations charged with delivering UKPMC were the University of Manchester (Mimas and the National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM)), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBl-EBI) and the British Library. In close collaboration with the NCBI, these partners have developed the website, the search and retrieval system, integrated text-mining-based features, manuscript submission and grant reporting tools. The UKPMC archive was supplemented by the CiteXplore citations database run by EMBL-EBI.</p>

<p>In November 2012 UKPMC was rebranded as Europe PubMed Central (Europe PMC) after three European funders (Telethon Italy, the Austrian Research Fund, and the European Research Council) joined UKPMC. In 2013 CiteXplore was subsumed under Europe PubMed Central. Since April 2016 EMBL-EBI is the sole organisation responsible for developing Europe PMC.</p>","Europe PMC is funded by 37 funders contributing to one grant and funder contributions are based on the annual research spend by the funding organisation (<a href=""https://europepmc.org/BecomeFunder"" target=""_blank"">https://europepmc.org/BecomeFunder</a>). The next grant renewal cycle is in 2026. Europe PMC is also supported by in-kind contributions from EMBL-EBI. Funding enables the infrastructure and maintenance of service to be continued and for new features and developments to be added to the roadmap to support the mission.","Implemented/available","https://europepmc.org/Governance","unknown","","Implemented/available","https://www.embl.org/about/info/course-and-conference-office/information-for-participants/code-of-conduct/","available","https://github.com/EuropePMC","Implemented/available","","Unknown","https://europepmc.org/Outreach","Implemented/available","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/equality-in-science","Implemented/available","https://europepmc.org/Governance","Implemented/available","https://europepmc.org/Governance","available","https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebServicehttps://europepmc.org/GristAPIhttps://europepmc.org/SoapWebServiceshttps://europepmc.org/AnnotationsApi","Implemented/available","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/licencing","No direct costs","","Implemented/available","https://europepmc.org/PrivacyNotice","Implemented/available","https://europepmc.org/Roadmap","Implemented/available","https://europepmc.org/developers","Implemented/available","https://europepmc.org/Accessibility","","","","","","false","Discovery system","","","Europe PMC conducted a POSI self-audit in 2022: <a href=""http://blog.europepmc.org/2022/02/EPMC-adopts-POSI.html"" target=""_blank"">http://blog.europepmc.org/2022/02/EPMC-adopts-POSI.html</a>","Code | Education / Training | User Research","","","Formal","Advisory board or steering committee","","","","","","","Contributions","","","","Not applicable","Actual system proven in operational environment","Actively Maintained","","","","Europe PMC exchanges data with PubMed / PubMed Central, Agricola, Crossref, ORCID, Unpaywall, and many other providers.

Functionality is developed by Institutional programmers and service providers and contributed back to the project.

<p>Similar to how open access research is research that has been licensed to be freely shared, read, cited and more, without restrictions or fees, FOSS is licensed to be freely shared, installed, and modified. More specifically, PKP employs the General Public License V3 for its FOSS and recommends that those using the software apply a CC BY 4.0 license to their open access publications.</p>

<p>The congruence in spirit and license that PKP has achieved between FOSS and open access has worked well in assisting the academic community in taking charge of scholarly publishing in the digital era. The resulting software has led to publishers, librarians, and scholars publishing millions of peer-reviewed articles and books around the world. It has also given rise to a new generation of FOSS preprint servers.</p>

<p>Building FOSS platforms leads to a distributed model of local installations that can develop regional technical capacities on a global scale. It encourages code contributions from among users, especially in the form of FOSS plugins for the platforms. It also facilitates users sharing translations of the software. PKP systems operate in more than 30 languages, while publishing research in 60 languages. In this way, FOSS reflects a spirit of cooperation and collaboration that underlies the spread of a more open science.</p>

<p>Open source + open access is also giving rise to more equitable forms of scholarly publishing. The best example of this is the OA diamond journal phenomenon, in which neither authors nor readers are charged for open access to the journal’s content. In 2021, the OA Diamond Journals Study led by Arianna Bercerril found that 60 percent of these publishing diamonds are using OJS, while they estimate that there may be as many as 29,000 OA diamond journals. If anything, this may be an undercount, given that in 2021 over 30,000 journals were found to be using OJS, almost entirely on diamond principles.</p>

Access to knowledge is key to a robust public commons and promoting an engaged citizenry; but in order to do this right, we need to have functional tools at the ready that real people can actually use.</p>

<p>Creative Commons’ legal tools are core open infrastructure, yet most people are unaware that the infrastructure behind the CC Licenses has had no underlying revenue stream to sustain regular maintenance or upgrades. Over the last 20 years, we’ve built up a “technical debt,” a backlog of work our small nonprofit organization hasn’t had the capacity to address.

Around 20,000 organisations are members so that they can create identifiers for metadata records that describe and locate their research. The records describe articles, book chapters, preprints, grants, and all kinds of digital or even physical objects relating to scholarly and professional research. Crossref members share the records through Crossref so that they don’t have to duplicate the information for the thousands who consume and use it downstream throughout the global research ecosystem.</p>

<p>The focus here is on the part of the Crossref infrastructure that facilitates the open and accessible retrieval of these metadata records, numbering over 150 million today. </p>

<p>Anyone can access to use these records without restriction, either through our search tool, search.crossref.org, or our REST API, api.crossref.org. There are no fees to use the metadata, but people who really rely on it may sign up for Metadata 'Plus', which offers greater predictability and higher rate limits.</p>

<p>People retrieving Crossref metadata need it for all sorts of reasons, including metaresearch (researchers studying research itself, such as through bibliometric analyses), publishing trends (such as finding works from an individual author or reviewer), or incorporation into specific databases (such as for discovery and search or in subject-specific repositories), and many more detailed use cases.</p>","Tools and services in all the categories listed tend to use Crossref metadata. The metadata is retrieved billions of times every month; the DOIs are clicked on or followed around 1.1 billion times a month (95% of all DOI usage); and additionally, the metadata is retrieved (through search and matching tools or our API) more than 1.2 billion times a month.","We envision a rich and reusable open network of relationships connecting research organizations, people, things, and actions; a scholarly record that the global community can build on forever, for the benefit of society.","<p>Crossref is governed by a <a href=""https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/"" target=""_blank"">Board of Directors</a>, elected by its members. </p>","<a href=""https://www.crossref.org/community/about/history/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.crossref.org/community/about/history/</a>

It is a not-for-profit service dedicated to the open access mission and one of the signatories of the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructures POSI.","","<p>CORE’s mission is to index all open access research worldwide and deliver unrestricted access for all. In doing so, we:</p>

<li> enrich scholarly data using state-of-the-art text and data mining technologies to aid discoverability,
<li> enable others to develop new tools and use cases on top of the CORE platform,
<li> support the network of open access repositories and journals with innovative technical, solutions and,
<li> facilitate a scalable, cost-effective route for the delivery of open scholarship.","<p>CORE is a <a href=""https://core.ac.uk/governance"" target=""_blank"">community governed service</a>, governed by an Advisory Board, Board of Supporters, The Open University Stakeholder Group, Research networks representatives, and CORE Leadership and management team. </p>","<p>The first version of CORE was created in 2010 by Petr Knoth as part of his PhD work with the aim to make it easier to access and text mine very large amounts of research publications. The value of the aggregation was first demonstrated by developing a content recommendation system for research papers. Since its start, CORE has received financial support from a range of funders including Jisc, the European Commission and for the provision of services to both public and private organisations. </p>

<p>CORE has been indexing research content from across the world; in 2017, it was calculated that it reached documents from 102 countries in 52 languages. While it has the status of the UK's national aggregator from repositories, it indexes metadata and full-text outputs from repositories and journals from across the world. </p>

<p>CORE operates as a one step search tool for UK's open access research outputs, facilitating discoverability, use and reuse. The importance of the service has been widely recognised by Jisc, which suggested that CORE should preserve the required resources to sustain its operation and explore an international sustainability model.</p>

<p>In 2018, CORE said it was the world's largest aggregator of open access research papers. Based on the open access fundamental principles, as they were described in the Budapest Open Access Initiative, its open access content not only must be openly available to download and read, but it must also allow its reuse, both by humans and machines. As a result, there was a need to exploit the content reuse, which could be made possible with the implementation of a technical infrastructure. The CORE project started with the goal of connecting metadata and full-text outputs offering, through content aggregation, value-added services, and by opening new opportunities in the research process.</p>

<p>In September 2022, Jisc informed the Open University that they will not be able to extend their funding towards CORE beyond July 2023. This triggered a rigorous response from UK HEIs, represented in particular by the United Kingdom Council of Open Research and Repositories (UKCORR), who requested that Jisc “reconsider, and ideally reverse, its decision to suspend CORE’s funding” and stated that an event where CORE becomes financially unviable and is eventually retired “would be disastrous for the reputation of open research in the UK.” </p>

<p>In response to this situation, on 1st December 2022, CORE launched a voluntary paid Membership Programme for CORE data providers, many of whom are HEIs. By the end of March 2023, 20 HEIs joined this programme including some of the most prestigious, such as the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge. The CORE membership programme has been designed with the goal of providing sufficient income to fully compensate for the loss of Jisc funds; increasing the diversity of income sources and achieving long-term sustainability of CORE.</p>","<p>As of 2023, the annual budget of CORE is around £600k. The cost of CORE is growing due to increases in server infrastructure costs, the growth of OA content and the need to index it, the growth of CORE""s users (currently ~ 30 million per month), and increases in the cost of human resources. The cost of CORE is expected to reach about £1m per annum within the next 5 years. </p>

</p>CORE, a community governed not-for-profit service, is currently supported by organisations utilising its data services and HEI Members. Membership contributions currently account for about 30% of CORE's income. </p>

</p>CORE relies on the Open research community to remain sustainable. The CORE leadership, including all of our governance groups, are grateful to our members, paying users and sponsors for financial support.</p>","Implemented/available","https://core.ac.uk/governance","unknown","","Implemented/available","https://github.com/oacore/search/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md","available","https://github.com/oacore","Implemented/available","","Implemented/available","https://core.ac.uk/governance/supporters","Considering","","In progress","","Implemented/available","https://core.ac.uk/governance","available","https://core.ac.uk/services/api","Implemented/available","https://core.ac.uk/services/dataset","Implemented/available","https://core.ac.uk/membership","Implemented/available","https://core.ac.uk/privacy","Implemented/available","","Implemented/available","https://core.ac.uk/membership-documentation","Implemented/available","https://core.ac.uk/accessibility","","","","","","false","Discovery system","","","CORE conducted a POSI self-audit in 2022: <a href=""https://blog.core.ac.uk/2022/05/23/core-our-commitment-to-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/"" target=""_blank"">https://blog.core.ac.uk/2022/05/23/core-our-commitment-to-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/</a>","Code | Development Roadmap | Documentation | Funds","","","Formal","Multi-board governance","","Fiscal sponsorship (academic institution)","","","","","Other","","","","Not applicable","Actual system proven in operational environment","Actively Maintained","","","","","","","","All content accessed through CORE is Open Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024-03-11T19:10:15Z","2024-08-21T15:42:11Z","2024-04-11T18:07:04Z","published","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://core.ac.uk/governance""}]}","{""link"":{}}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://github.com/oacore/search/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md""}]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://github.com/oacore""}]}","{""links"":[],""statement"":""Too often as researchers we exist within our own disciplines and institutes, each in our own silos, disconnected from each other.

Unesco's action at the time was decisive for the emergence of institutions of this kind in different countries. The initial choice of FGV was due to the fact that it was carrying out important activities in the area of bibliography and documentation.</p>

<p>At the time, the National Research Council (CNPq) was also being created, one of whose functions was to ""maintain relations with national and foreign institutions for the exchange of technical and scientific documentation"". Through a joint CNPq/FGV proposal, the Brazilian Institute of Bibliography and Documentation (IBBD) was created on 27 February 1954, by Decree of the President of the Republic No. 35,124, and became part of the CNPq's organisational structure.</p>

<p>The 1970s were marked by a reorganisation of science and technology activities in the country. The National Research Council was transformed into the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, expanding its power, transforming it into a foundation and linking it to the Planning Secretariat and the Presidency of the Republic. Like the CNPq, the IBBD underwent a transformation, including a change of name to the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (IBICT), with the publication of CNPq Executive Resolution 20/76. IBICT was then consolidated as the body that would coordinate S&T information activities in Brazil.</p>

<p>Since then, IBICT has also worked to promote the popularisation of scientific and technological information. Examples of this initiative are the ""Science at Five"" project, launched in 1987; a year later, the S&T Film Database; and, in 1993, the ""Appropriate Technologies Programme"".</p>

<p>Since 1975, IBICT has been acting as the National Centre of the ISSN Network, for assigning the international standard number to serial publications. From 1980, IBICT established itself as the Brazilian ISSN Centre and became the only member in Brazil to assign the ISSN code.</p>

<p>One of IBICT's first services, the National Collective Catalogue of Serial Publications (CCN), was created in 1954 by the then IBBD as a conventional card catalogue, providing information in person, by telephone or by correspondence. Since then, the service has kept pace with the evolution of technology, passing through the printed edition, microfiche and finally to its current electronic version.</p>

<p>The Bibliographic Commutation Programme (Comut), established by Ministerial Order 456 of 5 August 1980, is one of IBICT's traditional products, which makes it possible to obtain copies of technical scientific documents available in the collections of the main Brazilian libraries and international information services.</p>

<p>Today, IBICT is a reference in projects aimed at the movement for free access to knowledge. An example of this commitment is the Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (BDTD), launched in 2002, which uses the most modern open file technologies and integrates information systems for theses and dissertations from Brazilian teaching and research institutions. The BDBTD has a collection of more than 126,000 theses and dissertations from 90 educational institutions. This makes it the largest library of its kind in the world in terms of the number of records of theses and dissertations from a single country.</p>

<p>Also part of IBICT's recent history is the launch of CanalCiência, a portal for the dissemination of science and the popularisation of science, in 2002, which uses audiovisual media as a resource for including young people in the Information Society. It is worth noting that CanalCiência was nominated for the World Summit on the Information Society award as the best example of electronic content and creativity in this category.</p>

<p>In 2005, as well as improving its traditional services, IBICT expanded its activities to include other segments of society lacking organised information on the Web that were not yet part of its user community. To this end, it created the Social Inclusion Programme and began to use its expertise in organising, storing and disseminating information to support public policies aimed at the social field, particularly with regard to implementing direct actions in the field of information and digital learning.</p>","","Unknown","","unknown","","Implemented/available","https://brcris.ibict.br/about","available","https://github.com/projetos-codic-ibict","In progress","","Unknown","","Considering","","In progress","https://brcris.ibict.br/about","Unknown","","in_progress","","In progress","","Implemented/available","https://brcris.ibict.br/about","Implemented/available","https://brcris.ibict.br/about","In progress","","In progress","","Unknown","","","","","","","false","Discovery system | Research profiling system","","","","","","","Ad hoc","Advisory board or steering committee","","Non-profit organization","","","","","Other","","","","Not applicable","Actual system proven in operational environment","Actively Maintained","","","","","GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024-03-11T19:10:18Z","2024-08-21T15:42:11Z","2024-03-22T09:06:03Z","published","{""links"":[]}","{""link"":{}}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://brcris.ibict.br/about""}]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://github.com/projetos-codic-ibict""}]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://brcris.ibict.br/about""}]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://brcris.ibict.br/about""}]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://brcris.ibict.br/about""}]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""link"":{},""applies_to_solution"":false,""applies_to_website"":false}","[{""name"":""Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (Ibict)"",""description"":null,""url"":""https://ror.org/006c42y96""},{""name"":""LA Referencia"",""description"":null,""url"":""https://ror.org/024pbfj84""},{""name"":""Fiocruz"",""description"":null,""url"":""https://ror.org/04jhswv08""}]","[{""name"":""Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (Ibict)"",""description"":null,""url"":""https://ror.org/006c42y96""},{""name"":""Finep"",""description"":null,""url"":""https://ror.org/030w99567""},{""name"":""CNPq"",""description"":null,""url"":""https://ror.org/03swz6y49""},{""name"":""FAPDF"",""description"":null,""url"":""https://ror.org/04djvx395""}]","[]","[]","[]"

Through its services, it supports national Open Access strategies in Latin America through a platform with interoperability standards, sharing and giving visibility to the scientific production generated in institutions of higher education and scientific research.</p>

<p>From the national nodes, scientific articles, doctoral and master's theses are integrated, coming from more than a hundred universities and research institutions from the ten countries that now form LA Referencia. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Spain, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Uruguay.</p>

<p>This experience is based on technical and organizational agreements between public science and technology agencies (Ministries and Oncyts ) of the member countries, together with RedCLARA. LA Referencia was born through the Cooperation Agreement, signed in Buenos Aires in 2012, which reflects the political will to offer in open access the scientific production of Latin America as a regional public good with emphasis on the results financed with public funds.</p>","Some of the achievements at a technical and institutional level are:
<li>We are a federated network with 11 member countries and presence in international discussions linked to open science.</li>
<li>A consolidation of a regional aggregator portal with metadata validation and enrichment in accordance with OpenAIRE guidelines (aligned with Europe).</li>
<li>OAI-PMH interoperability service added by OpenAIRE, BASE and other regional aggregators, making Latin American production visible in Europe.</li>
<li>More than 5 million metadata records on regional scientific production</li>
<li>Regional usage statistics service compatible with OpenAIRE, in collaboration with FECYT/RECOLECTA from Spain.</li>
<li>Open software platform published on Github installed in LA Referencia´s country nodes, Portugal (RCAAP/FCT-FCCN) and Africa</li>
<li>Regional collaboration and participation in international projects (SCOSS, COAR Notify, OpenAIRE)</li>","LA Referencia gives visibility to the scientific production of higher education and research institutions in Latin America, promotes open and free access to the full text, with special emphasis on publicly financed results.","<p>La Referencia is <a href=""https://www.lareferencia.info/en/institutional/partners-and-representatives"" target=""_blank"">governed by</a> a Board of Directors, network of Political Authorities from node countries, and a Technical Committee. </p>","<p>LA Referencia originated as a project coordinated by the Latin American Cooperation of Advanced Networks (RedCLARA) and funded by the Public Goods Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) from 2010 to 2013. It involved the collaboration of scientific and technological institutions alongside a portion of the Network Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in the region.</p>

<p>Initially, its focus was on establishing agreements and policies related to federated access, standardized policies, interoperability standards, and a technology pilot.</p>

<p>In this context, LA Referencia emerged from the Cooperation Agreement signed in Buenos Aires in 2012. This agreement reflected the political determination to provide the scientific output of Latin America openly, emphasizing the regional public benefit of works financed with public funds.</p>

<p>Following the conclusion of the IDB project in 2013, the network transitioned into a permanent initiative sustained by the national authorities in Science and Technology across the region, with the backing of RedCLARA. The primary goal remains the establishment of an open access strategy for scientific publications based on national policies and the development of services intended for the public good</p>

<a href=""https://www.lareferencia.info/en/institutional/history"" target=""_blank"">Source</a>","LA Referencia’s operations have been financed exclusively with the annual contributions of the member countries, with occasional grant funding for innovation or the development of new functionalities. This budget supports the development and ongoing maintenance of the aggregation software in the central node and the country nodes. But if we think in the expansion of services, technological updating and consolidate a platform for the implementation of Open Science public policies, LA Referencia requires an additional funding source, otherwise may be in the risk of falling behind the current challenges.","Unknown","","available","https://github.com/lareferencia/lareferencia-repository-dashboard/blob/main/LICENSE","In progress","","available","https://github.com/lareferencia","Considering","","Considering","","Considering","","Implemented/available","https://www.lareferencia.info/es/recursos/documentos/actas-consejo-directivo","Implemented/available","https://www.lareferencia.info/en/institutional/partners-and-representatives","considering","","Considering","","No direct costs","","In progress","","Considering","","In progress","http://doc.lareferencia.info/es/home","Unknown","","","","","","","false","Discovery system","","","","","","","Formal","Multi-board governance","","Non-profit organization","","","","","Other","","","","Not applicable","Actual system proven in operational environment","Actively Maintained","","","","OpenAIRE, COAR Notify, Redalyc, SciELO, ROR, CORE, BASE, CVLattes, DSpace, Vivo","GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3","","","Different Creative Commons Licences and custom intitutional licences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024-03-11T19:10:33Z","2024-08-21T15:42:11Z","2024-03-22T09:06:07Z","published","{""links"":[]}","{""link"":{""url"":""https://github.com/lareferencia/lareferencia-repository-dashboard/blob/main/LICENSE""}}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://github.com/lareferencia""}]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://www.lareferencia.info/es/recursos/documentos/actas-consejo-directivo""},{""url"":""https://www.lareferencia.info/en/institutional/partners-and-representatives""}]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://www.lareferencia.info/en/institutional/partners-and-representatives""},{""url"":""https://www.lareferencia.info/es/recursos/documentos/actas-consejo-directivo""}]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""http://doc.lareferencia.info/es/home""}]}","{""link"":{},""applies_to_solution"":false,""applies_to_website"":false}","[{""name"":""MINCYT- Argentina"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""ANID - Chile"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""ANII- Uruguay"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""MINCIENCIAS- Ecuador"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""IBICT-Brasil"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""CONARE - Costa Rica"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""CONACYT - Perú"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""SENACYT - Panamá"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""FECYT - Spain"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""CEDIA - Ecuador"",""description"":null,""url"":null}]","[{""name"":""IDB (Interamerican Development Bank)"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""MINCYT- Argentina"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""ANID - Chile"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""ANII- Uruguay"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""MINCIENCIAS- Ecuador"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""IBICT-Brasil"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""CONARE - Costa Rica"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""CONACYT - Perú"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""SENACYT - Panamá"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""FECYT - Spain"",""description"":null,""url"":null},{""name"":""CEDIA - Ecuador"",""description"":null,""url"":null}]","[{""name"":""Fourth Funding Cycle of SCOSS"",""starts_on"":null,""ends_on"":null,""display_date"":""2023 to 2025"",""funder"":""Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Simon Fraser University"",""amount"":null,""grant_activities"":null,""award_announcement_url"":null,""notes"":null}]","[]","[]"

Currently the Sherpa collection holds data on 3,503 global publisher OA policies; including data on 28,000 journal OA policies; includes data on 178 major global funders OA policy requirements and OpenDOAR holds data on 5,868 global institutional repositories supporting global aggregation efforts of aggregating articles from global IRs. Access to this data is free and will always remain free to all, via a recently upgraded web UI and API. Our data is used to prime global initiatives aimed at helping authors and institutions make informed and confident decisions in open access publication, compliance and in increasing aggregation of OA material along with tracking the growth of global institutional repositories.","Sherpa Services - Helping authors and institutions to make informed and confident decisions in open access publication and compliance.
OpenDOAR - The world’s authoritative and quality-assured directory of open access repositories.","<p>Sherpa Services is an initiative of Jisc, which is <a href=""https://beta.jisc.ac.uk/about-us/board"" target=""_blank"">governed by</a> a Board of Trustees. </p>","Sherpa, founded in 2002, initially operated from the University of Nottingham in the Centre for Research Communications. Following several years of development and growth, the team and its suite of services were transitioned to Jisc in 2015. This move aligned with changes in the organisational structure, marking a strategic shift in the management of the Sherpa project.
The team is presently integrated into the Research Management Team within Digital Resources at Jisc. Changes to the organisational structure over time came due to evolving sector goals, operational needs and were influenced by broader shifts in the landscape of research and academic support services. Our journey from the University of Nottingham to Jisc reflects a strategic realignment influenced by the changing landscape of digital resources and the need for a more expansive and centrally managed approach.","The Sherpa product line is currently overseen and operated by Jisc on behalf of the global OA community. While Jisc has allocated resources for the implementation and maintenance of these products, they remain operationally under-resourced given the extensive data curation and collection management tasks they handle. Automating these operations poses a challenge due to the absence (and reluctance) of interoperable links with publisher systems.
Although Sherpa services receive some global funding through the SCOSS initiative, for which we are grateful, this funding is voluntary and does not establish a sustainable, long-term support framework. We are seeking assistance in establishing a global membership-based funding model. Future funding will enable us to develop intuitive interfaces for our data, benefiting the global OA sector. This will enhance our data collection efforts, allowing us to expand both the quantity and types of data collected, such as lists of institutional rights retention policies, global transitional agreements, and providing data/statistics to support global horizon scans on policy changes resulting from open access initiatives.","Unknown","","unknown","","Considering","","not_planning","","Implemented/available","","Implemented/available","https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=SHERPAUSERS","Implemented/available","https://beta.jisc.ac.uk/about-us/equality-diversity-and-inclusion","In progress","","Implemented/available","https://beta.jisc.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance","available","https://www.sherpa.ac.uk/api/","Implemented/available","https://beta.jisc.ac.uk/website/copyright?loc=cc","No direct costs","","Implemented/available","https://beta.jisc.ac.uk/website/privacy-notice","Considering","","Implemented/available","https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/api/","Implemented/available","https://beta.sherpa.ac.uk/accessibility","","","","","","false","Open access policy information compilation","","","POSI Audits have been carried out internally - but the results of these are not public.

Oasisbr is supported and governed by the nonprofit collaborative repository group <a href=""http://rbrd.ibict.br/"" target=""_blank"">Rede Brasileira de Repositórios Digitais (RBRD)</a>. </p>","<p>In the first half of the 20th century, Brazil began to build up and maintain a scientific and technological infrastructure, with the creation of universities and science and research institutes. After the Second World War, the flow of information worldwide increased and the organization of scientific information became increasingly important for development. In this context, the newly created United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) sought to stimulate bibliographic organization worldwide. </p>

<p>In the early 1950s, UNESCO, the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) and the CNPq began preparations for the creation of a bibliographic center in Brazil with the aim of boosting national scientific and technological activities. Librarians Lydia Sambaquy and Jannice Monte-Mor visited the main libraries and documentation centers in Europe and the United States to look for organizational models. </p>

<p>In 1954, with the support of the Brazilian government, the Brazilian Institute of Librarianship and Documentation (IBBD) was created and set up in Rio de Janeiro, which became part of the CNPq's organizational structure. Among its objectives, the institute sought to promote bibliographic and documentation services, establish exchanges with international technical-scientific documentation institutions and develop training and further training courses in Library Science and Documentation.</p> 

<p>Its first president was Lydia Sambaquy, who was IBBD's director for 11 years. In 1956, IBBD started the Scientific Documentation Course. At the specialization level, the course was a pioneering postgraduate course in the field of bibliography and documentation in Brazil and Latin America, and opened up a new field of professional action. The institute sought to provide scientific and technological information to researchers who requested it and guided librarians from different regions of Brazil in providing scientific information services to the academic community. </p>

<p>""The founding of Ibict at that time was very important because there was a huge volume of information and it was dispersed and disorganized. The IBBD began to organize scientific knowledge by area and was fundamental to the scientific and technological development of that time. It helped Brazil to be seen as a country that was at the forefront of the field, at the forefront of this issue. And vanguardism became the keynote of Ibict,"" says Cecília Leite. </p>

<p>Soon the IBDD would also stand out for its innovation. The first copying machine from Xerox do Brasil, a company founded in 1965, was installed at the IBBD in December 1966. In 1968, the IBBD was the first body in Latin America to have automated information systems, as well as automating its traditional services. In that year, the institute launched the first Brazilian Bibliography formed by an automated process. For some historical thinkers in the field of information in Brazil, this event was a founding milestone of Information Science in the country.</p>

<p>The 1970s were marked by a reorganization of science and technology activities in the country, with the strengthening of public policies for scientific and technological development. In the field of information, the advent of computers and electronics changed paradigms and opened up new possibilities. </p>

<p>In 1970, librarians Célia Ribeiro Zaher and Hagar Espanha Gomes, then president and vice-president of IBBD, created the first Master's course in Information Science in South America, in an agreement with the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), opening doors to the field of information science studies and the training of professionals in the area. Two years later, the IBBD created the journal Ciência da Informação, the first scientific journal in the field in Brazil. </p>

<p>In 1976, the IBBD was renamed Ibict and in 1980, the institute moved its headquarters from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília. In 1985, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT) was created and in 2000, Ibict became subordinate to the ministry. Ibict was then consolidated as the body that would coordinate science and technology information activities in Brazil, with services aimed at the academic community, the research sector, the productive sector and the government.</p>","","Unknown","","unknown","","Considering","","available","https://github.com/projetos-codic-ibict/oasisbr-vufind","Considering","","Considering","","Considering","","Implemented/available","","Implemented/available","https://oasisbr.ibict.br/vufind/about/home","available","https://oasisbr.ibict.br/vufind/swagger-ui/","Implemented/available","https://oasisbr.ibict.br/vufind/about/home","No direct costs","","Considering","","Considering","","Considering","","Unknown","","","","","","","false","Repository service","","","","","","","None","","","Fiscal sponsorship (academic institution)","","","","","Program service revenue","","","","Not applicable","Actual system proven in operational environment","Actively Maintained","","","","<a href=""https://github.com/lareferencia"" target=""_blank"">LA Referencia Platform</a>","GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3","","","https://github.com/lareferencia/lareferencia-oai-pmh/blob/master/LICENSE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024-03-11T19:10:37Z","2024-08-21T15:42:11Z","2024-03-22T09:06:09Z","published","{""links"":[]}","{""link"":{}}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://github.com/projetos-codic-ibict/oasisbr-vufind""}]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://oasisbr.ibict.br/vufind/about/home""}]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://oasisbr.ibict.br/vufind/swagger-ui/""}]}","{""links"":[{""url"":""https://oasisbr.ibict.br/vufind/about/home""}]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""links"":[]}","{""link"":{},""applies_to_solution"":false,""applies_to_website"":false}","[{""name"":""Instituto Brasileiro de Informação em Ciência e Tecnologia (Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology) (Ibict)"",""description"":null,""url"":null}]","[{""name"":""Instituto Brasileiro de Informação em Ciência e Tecnologia (Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology) (Ibict)"",""description"":null,""url"":null}]","[]","[{""name"":""Finep (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, Funding Authority for Studies and Projects)"",""description"":null,""url"":null}]","[]"
