It facilitates making data available to others and allows you to replicate others' work more easily. Researchers, journals, data authors, publishers, data distributors, and affiliated institutions all receive academic credit and web visibility.</p>

<p>A Dataverse repository is the software installation, which then hosts multiple virtual archives called Dataverse collections. Each Dataverse collection contains datasets, and each dataset contains descriptive metadata and data files (including documentation and code that accompany the data). As an organizing method, Dataverse collections may also contain other Dataverse collections.</p>",https://dataverse.org/,https://ror.org/03vek6s52,https://dataverse.org/files/dataverseorg/files/dataverse_r_project.png,United States,"The mission of the Dataverse Project is to revolutionize the way data is managed and shared by automating tasks traditionally carried out by professional archivists. Our goal is to empower data creators by providing services that allow them to receive proper credit for their data while ensuring long-term preservation. We aim to eliminate the dilemma researchers faced in the past, where they had to choose between control and credit or preservation. With the Dataverse Project, we break this dichotomy by creating a Dataverse collection on your website that maintains your branding and URL, offers academic citation for the data, and provides full credit and visibility. Dataverse in addition to what is mentioned above, also has fully-fledged support for quality control, e.g., in the form of curation workflows. Simultaneously, our Dataverse repositories, backed by institutions, guarantee long-term preservation.","<li> The Dataverse UI is being redesigned as a single-page application (SPA) in which internal and external Dataverse services will be delivered solely through improved APIs.

<p>We have also done important work toward addressing gender imbalances in structures like the IIIF Editorial Committee and the co-chairs of our Technical Specification Groups.

Though we have made important strides in making online meetings a primary means of IIIF business, there remains the fact that the writing of open standards and specifications is most efficiently done via focused in-person meetings. In order to foster a more diverse and sustainable Editorial Committee and set of technical group co-chairs, the IIIF Consortium is exploring funding options that would allow us to continue this important work without sacrificing the efficiency of in-person meetings to move the specifications forward.</p>",I,2011,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,https://iiif.io/community/,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/,https://iiif.io/guides/,"Award title - IIIF 3D Summit

<p>Similar to how open access research is research that has been licensed to be freely shared, read, cited and more, without restrictions or fees, FOSS is licensed to be freely shared, installed, and modified. More specifically, PKP employs the General Public License V3 for its FOSS and recommends that those using the software apply a CC BY 4.0 license to their open access publications.</p>

<p>The congruence in spirit and license that PKP has achieved between FOSS and open access has worked well in assisting the academic community in taking charge of scholarly publishing in the digital era. The resulting software has led to publishers, librarians, and scholars publishing millions of peer-reviewed articles and books around the world. It has also given rise to a new generation of FOSS preprint servers.</p>

<p>Building FOSS platforms leads to a distributed model of local installations that can develop regional technical capacities on a global scale. It encourages code contributions from among users, especially in the form of FOSS plugins for the platforms. It also facilitates users sharing translations of the software. PKP systems operate in more than 30 languages, while publishing research in 60 languages. In this way, FOSS reflects a spirit of cooperation and collaboration that underlies the spread of a more open science.</p>

<p>Open source + open access is also giving rise to more equitable forms of scholarly publishing. The best example of this is the OA diamond journal phenomenon, in which neither authors nor readers are charged for open access to the journal’s content. In 2021, the OA Diamond Journals Study led by Arianna Bercerril found that 60 percent of these publishing diamonds are using OJS, while they estimate that there may be as many as 29,000 OA diamond journals. If anything, this may be an undercount, given that in 2021 over 30,000 journals were found to be using OJS, almost entirely on diamond principles.</p>

45,OSF (Open Science Framework),"Center for Open Science, Inc.","OSF is a free, open-source project management and collaboration tool that supports researchers throughout the entire research lifecycle - from planning, to conducting, to reporting, and discovering research.",https://osf.io,https://ror.org/05d5mza29,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KY47dYOSQWg4MeYYitBuaKOWbLiV9fMS/view?usp=sharing,United States,"Our mission is to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research.","<p>OSF has surpassed 600,000 registered users, and passed 500,000 in 2022 (currently adding >370 per day). These users representing all domains of science and engineering have registered more than 122,000 studies, created more than 616,000 projects, stored more than 18M files, publicly shared more than 9.1M of those files, and posted more than 125,000 papers. Research consumers do not need to register an account to view and download public content on OSF. The yearly consumer user base is more than 10x the size of the cumulative registered users base with >21 million unique visitors that viewed >54 million files and downloaded ~52 million files in 2022 alone.</p>

<p>OSF has two central differentiators from other tools in the marketplace supporting open science. The first is OSF’s unique, secure, open-source architecture that supports integrations with other tools and services that researchers rely on. OSF connects the phases and contents of the research lifecycle together and enables fluid public and private research management to increase efficiency and reduce time needed for re-uploading, moving, or looking for resources. The second is that OSF supports lifecycle open science. OSF can be used as a retrospective repository to share research data and other assets after the research project is completed. But, its core value proposition is that it supports the researcher from conception through completion, consumption, and re-use. By supporting the entire lifecycle, OSF makes researchers more efficient, makes their work more rigorous, and makes it easier to connect and share some or all of the history and products of the research.</p>

<p>The COS team continually engages with users and stakeholders to understand the ways collaborators, data consumers, and funders need to search and browse the corpus of public research output on OSF.  Years of feedback were integrated with new user testing, which focused on discovery features that would provide the most value for researchers. Further analysis determined how users would expect the features to work and how results would be interpreted. Finally, we overlapped this feedback with other stakeholder needs, like funder programs and institutional administrators that are working with research communities to more effectively track and report research plans and results. The result of the community and stakeholder input is a new discovery solution on OSF with a suite of brand new search features, making it easier and faster to find OSF content that meets their precise needs. These same features provide unique insights for institutional administrators, funder program officers, and librarians, including more ways to find relevant funding opportunities and interdisciplinary or inter-institutional collaborations. Most critically the <a href=""https://www.cos.io/blog/new-osf-search-features-for-rapid-research-findability-and-sharing"" target=""_blank"">new discovery features</a>, in addition to the robust metadata enabled on OSF, enables researchers and research institutions to meet funder and publisher data sharing commitments.</p>",4,Implemented/available,https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io,4,Implemented/available,https://Doi.Org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CNWJ3,4,Implemented/available,https://help.osf.io/,4,Implemented/available,https://www.cos.io/about/board,3,In progress,NULL,4,Implemented/available,https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019737894-FAQs#what-accessibility-standards-does-osf-adhere-to,2,Our tool or project,4,Implemented/available,https://www.cos.io/products/osf-preprints,4,Implemented/available,https://www.cos.io/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-at-cos,4,Implemented/available,"Communities are the context in which norms for open scholarship are established and evolve, and they are a central component of the Center for Open Science’s (COS) Theory of Change.

However, that promise will not be realized if the policies are implemented poorly such that data sharing is highly burdensome, error prone, or difficult to monitor. Administrative activities are already a substantial burden on researchers, and increasingly so over time (Barham et al., 2014). Every bit of friction that can be removed from the implementation of data-sharing policies contributes to advancing knowledge by allowing current and next-generation researchers to spend their time and attention where it should be -- doing research. Addressing burden in the implementation of rigor and transparency-enhancing policies is essential for making U.S.-based researchers more competitive in a global research environment.</p>

Participants were compensated with $100 for their time and expertise. </p>

<p>Alongside sprints we have also run 9 community calls, again at different times of day to accommodate participation from our global community. We had 13 participants to community calls.</p>

To date we have run 21 training interventions and worked with 12 partner organizations to provide peer review training to approximately 300 participants (this number is estimated as for some workshops the partner organization has managed registration). Alongside working with partner organizations to provide dedicated training for their cohort, we also have delivered 4 free-to-attend 2-hour community workshops including 35 participants from around the world. </p>

<p>Included in this figure of workshops is Open Peer Reviewers in Africa, tailored to the region-specific context of African researchers. This was a collaboration between PREreview, AfricArXiv, Eider Africa, eLife, and the Training Centre in Communication Africa (TCC Africa). Together we co-created and openly shared tools and strategies for scholarly literature evaluation, and trained the first cohort of 11 African researchers with 5 trainees moving on to be open peer review trainers themselves (<a href=""https://content.prereview.org/open-peer-reviewers-in-africa-a-train-of-trainer-program"" target=""_blank"">https://content.prereview.org/open-peer-reviewers-in-africa-a-train-of-trainer-program</a>).</p>

From the start, we embraced a shared leadership approach, capitalizing on our diverse skills, experiences, and personalities to strengthen our team. 

Our first grant in 2018 was a $2,500 Mozilla Foundation “mini-grant” which went to supporting refreshments for a number of in-person preprint review events. 
In March 2019, Daniela Saderi transitioned to a full-time role as the project director, supported by the Mozilla Foundation as a fellow for open science. 

PREreview also became a fiscally sponsored project of the non-profit organization Code for Science and Society, firmly rooted in a non-profit model to align with our values of openness and community prioritization over commercialization. 
Initial funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation enabled the creation of the first prototype of PREreview.org. Subsequent support from the Wellcome Trust allowed us to develop a second iteration and introduce new tools for collaborative peer review.

From 2020 and 2022, we entered a collaboration with the non-profit journal eLife to support efforts to expand peer-review training to more communities. To date, we continue to partner with eLife to advance open evaluation of preprints. In 2022, a significant two-year grant from the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, in collaboration with eLife, led to the development of the best-ever third version of PREreview.org, offering accessible tools and resources while facilitating increased community engagement and input.",Code for Science and Society (PREreview's fiscal sponsor),Code for Science and Society (PREreview's fiscal sponsor),"<p>When PREreview started in 2017, there were two active preprint review platforms: Academic Karma and Peer Community In (PCI). However, Academic Karma, later known as Preprint.Space, has since closed. Over recent years, numerous preprint review and highlighting projects have arisen due to the growing interest in enhancing scholarly publishing and the need for ways to curate and filter the expanding non-peer-reviewed literature. </p>

<p>This need became evident in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional journal peer review couldn't keep up with the rapid sharing of pandemic-related preprints. Initiatives like the Outbreak Science Rapid PREreview (now on PREreview.org), Rapid Reviews Covid-19 (RR:C19, now Rapid Review Infectious Disease, RR:ID) Overlay Journal, 2019 Novel Coronavirus Research Compendium (NCRC), and the Oxford-Mount Sinai (OxMS) Preprint Journal Club responded to this demand. There are also established preprint review and highlighting initiatives like PCI, preLights, Review Commons, PubPeer, and PeerRef (although this last one was recently discontinued). </p>

<p>These initiatives demonstrate the demand for alternative peer review approaches and community involvement, emphasizing the importance of financial support to sustain their momentum and success.</p>

<p>PREreview is a unique platform that's both author- and community-driven, open to researchers at any career stage. In contrast, other initiatives like PCI and Review Commons offer peer review services only when requested by authors and rely on invited reviewers. PREreview empowers the community to self-regulate their reviews, encourages post-moderation, and provides training in constructive criticism and peer review skills.</p>

<p>One of PREreview's main goals is to make peer review more accessible to early-career researchers and marginalized groups. Unlike other initiatives, it addresses the issue of peer review being an invite-only system that favors recognized experts and often neglects emerging voices. PREreview is also unique in allowing reviewers to use pseudonyms to protect their identities while contributing to the peer review process and being held accountable for any code of conduct violations.</p>

<p>Additionally, PREreview is dedicated to training early-career researchers (ECRs) to become socially conscious peer reviewers, filling a gap that other preprint review initiatives haven't addressed. Other training programs are often limited in access or lack ongoing recruitment, leaving ECRs underserved in this critical training opportunity.</p>",1,Contributions,0,,5,Actual system proven in operational environment,1,Actively maintained,"Crossref, DataCite, ORCID, Zenodo","Airtable, Azure, CiviCRM, Cloudinary, COAR Notify Protocol, Fathom, Ghost, Google Drive, OAuth, Sciety, Slack",NULL,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,,3,In progress,NULL,4,Implemented/available,https://content.prereview.org/exciting-platform-news-for-prereview-in-2023,TRUE,656784,114987,0,0,114987,81097,114987,7186,"<p>PREreview is governed by an <a href=""https://content.prereview.org/people/"" target=""_blank"">Advisory Committee</a>, and is a fiscally sponsored project of <a href=""https://www.codeforsociety.org/"" target=""_blank"">Code for Science &amp; Society</a>, a US-based 501(c)3</p>",mailto:contact@prereview.org?subject=Referred%20by%20IOI's%20Infra%20Finder%20and%20want%20to%20know%20more,NULL,NULL,5,Not applicable,3,Project,4,Unknown,3,unknown,"<p>Investing in PREreview means supporting an independent, non-for-profit organization dedicated to transforming scholarly evaluation through the lenses of openness, equity and collaboration.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 by three early-career women scientists, PREreview primarily relies on grants and has had only one full-time employee, the director, with a volunteer leadership team for the first 3 years. In 2022, thanks to investment from the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, we added three new team members who brought us to new highs. We now offer services like peer-review training workshops and collaborative review sessions to research institutions, funders, and publishers, moving from grants to a service-based model while staying true to their mission.
However, we can't fully sustain ourselves with service contracts alone. We believe we are at a turning point, with strong technology and community support. We are asking for support from organizations, governments, and others who share our values to help transform research evaluation, with a focus on marginalized groups in academia.</p>
 
<p>Such support will open up new opportunities for us to partner and build trust with like-minded organizations who are active in their communities. In the next 2-3 years, we plan to improve and scale 3 pillars that support researchers' journeys towards more open, fair, and collaborative peer review: 1) inclusive and accessible training in open review practices, 2) an authoring platform integrated with the peer-review ecosystem that supports rigorous and ethical open peer review, and 3) collaborative groups we call clubs that will allow users from diverse groups to continue building their own, decentralized communities of open peer-review practice supported by our training and platform.</p>",PR,2017,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"The numbers reported above refer to fiscal year 2022/2023.

This group roughly came from three projects that similarly operated cloud infrastructure for interactive computing:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The Berkeley DataHub is an institution-wide JupyterHub that was led in-part by Yuvi Panda, Chris Holdgraf, Cathryn Carson, and Fernando Perez.
<li> The Syzygy project (<a href=""https://syzygy.ca"">https://syzygy.ca</a>) is a network of JupyterHubs for Canadian universities that was led in-part by Jim Colliander.
<li> The Pangeo project (<a href=""https://pangeo.io"">https://pangeo.io</a>) is a community platform for Big Data geoscience that is built on a JupyterHub and cloud computing, and is led in-part by Ryan Abernathey.
</ul>
</p>
<p>Each of these projects demonstrated considerable value for the communities it served, but it was also clear that this model was unsustainable for most other communities of practice due to difficulties in hiring for cloud engineering skills.</p>

<p>As a result, communities tended to use proprietary services that weren't aligned with the values many of us identified with (e.g., community-driven infrastructure, values-based organizations, non-profit structures, etc).</p>

<p>We created 2i2c in order to have a mission-driven and community-focused organization that could design and manage cloud infrastructure on behalf of communities of practice, but that framed the partnership as a collaboration based around shared responsibility and transparency rather than a pure ""consumer / producer relationship"". We also wanted to ensure that 2i2c would commit to making upstream contributions and support as part of its key mission, in order to avoid the extractive relationship many organizations have with open source.</p>","<p>non-2i2c organizations currently represented on 2i2c's Steering Council:</p>

<li> University of California at Berkeley (Fernando Perez, Cathryn Carson)
<li> Columbia University and Earthmover (Ryan Abernathey)
<li> University of British Columbia (Lindsey Heagy, Jim Colliander)

<p>Invest in Open Infrastructure is providing governance strategy and support for a project we are leading called The Catalyst Project.

<p>Now more than ever, society needs open knowledge to have any chance at addressing the world’s most pressing challenges. We need open research and data to address the climate crisis; open images, audio, and reporting accessible to journalists confronting financial constraints and the challenges of “fake news;” freely available museum and library collections, because art and culture are often central to social change efforts; and open educational resources so K-12 schools, college students, and everyday learners can access affordable textbooks and other curriculum. Access to knowledge is key to a robust public commons and promoting an engaged citizenry; but in order to do this right, we need to have functional tools at the ready that real people can actually use.</p>

<p>Creative Commons’ legal tools are core open infrastructure, yet most people are unaware that the infrastructure behind the CC Licenses has had no underlying revenue stream to sustain regular maintenance or upgrades. Over the last 20 years, we’ve built up a “technical debt,” a backlog of work our small nonprofit organization hasn’t had the capacity to address.  With proper funding, Creative Commons can resolve immediate technical shortcomings while establishing an agile and streamlined maintenance routine that will allow the CC Licenses to thrive and evolve with a rapidly changing digital landscape.</p>",C,2001,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Arcadia Fund, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Filecoin Foundation, Argosy Foundation, the Eric Saltzman and Victoria Munroe Charitable Fund, MHz Foundation, Google, Caktus Group, the Samuel H.

The Science Advisory Council represents the scientific and research community of arXiv (those who create valuable content and who systematically read this content); the Institutions Advisory Council represents the scholarly communications community, including librarians and information science and publishing professionals; the Editorial Advisory Council functions as arXiv's Editorial Board and is both advisory and operational (members are the chairs of the Section Editorial Committees).</p>

<p>Section Editorial Committees recruit and onboard arXiv's moderators. arXiv's moderators are volunteer subject matter experts with terminal degrees in their field. They evaluate each submission’s content and category, following arXiv policies.  Currently there are 200+ arXiv moderators involved in the day-to-day process of reviewing submissions and resolving issues so that papers can move through to announcement. </p>

<p>arXiv’s HTML Papers project is another example of arXiv’s commitment to community engagement – through surveys and forums, arXiv learned that researchers with disabilities were being left behind by the limitations of PDF articles, which happen to currently be the standard format in scientific communication. The HTML Papers project strives to open scientific research to all by providing a tech-readable, user-friendly format (HTML) for every paper, so that every single formula may be read by researchers, regardless of disability. </p>

<p>arXiv also collaborates with arXiv users and startup companies (such as ScienceCast and HuggingFace) to discover new ways to make arXiv papers more searchable and create tools for interoperability. arXivLabs is a framework arXiv uses to enabling the arXiv community to contribute to arXiv and develop tools that can benefit the scientific community. </p>

<p>arXiv also distributes a yearly survey to active arXiv users to learn what parts of the arXiv service users most value, what parts need improvement, as well as testing where arXiv stands on matters important to the scientific community. This survey routinely receives over 5,000 responses, and arXiv creates strategic initiatives in accordance with the responses.</p>",NULL,NULL,https://info.arxiv.org/labs/index.html,Implemented/available,https://info.arxiv.org/help/policies/code_of_conduct.html,Implemented/available,https://info.arxiv.org/help/policies/privacy_policy.html,,,2,Formal,https://info.arxiv.org/about/arXiv_bylaws.html,2,Multi-board governance,2,Fiscal sponsorship (academic institution),18,"History available from these sources:

The value of the aggregation was first demonstrated by developing a content recommendation system for research papers. Since its start, CORE has received financial support from a range of funders including Jisc, the European Commission and for the provision of services to both public and private organisations. </p>

<p>CORE has been indexing research content from across the world; in 2017, it was calculated that it reached documents from 102 countries in 52 languages. While it has the status of the UK's national aggregator from repositories, it indexes  metadata and full-text outputs from repositories and journals from across the world. </p>

<p>CORE operates as a one step search tool for UK's open access research outputs, facilitating discoverability, use and reuse. The importance of the service has been widely recognised by Jisc, which suggested that CORE should preserve the required resources to sustain its operation and explore an international sustainability model.</p>

<p>In 2018, CORE said it was the world's largest aggregator of open access research papers. Based on the open access fundamental principles, as they were described in the Budapest Open Access Initiative, its open access content not only must be openly available to download and read, but it must also allow its reuse, both by humans and machines. As a result, there was a need to exploit the content reuse, which could be made possible with the implementation of a technical infrastructure. The CORE project started with the goal of connecting metadata and full-text outputs offering, through content aggregation, value-added services, and by opening new opportunities in the research process.</p>

<p>In September 2022, Jisc informed the Open University that they will not be able to extend their funding towards CORE beyond July 2023. This triggered a rigorous response from UK HEIs, represented in particular by the United Kingdom Council of Open Research and Repositories (UKCORR), who requested that Jisc “reconsider, and ideally reverse, its decision to suspend CORE’s funding” and stated that an event where CORE becomes financially unviable and is eventually retired “would be disastrous for the reputation of open research in the UK.” </p>

<p>In response to this situation, on 1st December 2022, CORE launched a voluntary paid Membership Programme for CORE data providers, many of whom are HEIs. By the end of March 2023, 20 HEIs joined this programme including some of the most prestigious, such as the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge. The CORE membership programme has been designed with the goal of providing sufficient income to fully compensate for the loss of Jisc funds; increasing the diversity of income sources and achieving long-term sustainability of CORE.</p>",The Open University,The Open University,,2,Other,NULL,,5,Actual system proven in operational environment,1,Actively maintained,,,NULL,All content accessed through CORE is Open Access,"OAI-PMH, ResourceSync, Dublin Core, Rioxx, SOA, ...",4,Implemented/available,https://core.ac.uk/services/api,4,Implemented/available,NULL,TRUE,780000,780000,0,0,450000,0,330000,0,"<p>CORE is a <a href=""https://core.ac.uk/governance"" target=""_blank"">community governed service</a>, governed by an Advisory Board, Board of Supporters, The Open University Stakeholder Group, Research networks representatives, and CORE Leadership and management team. </p>",https://core.ac.uk/about#contact,NULL,NULL,5,Not applicable,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,3,unknown,"<p>As of 2023, the annual budget of CORE is around £600k.

Unesco's action at the time was decisive for the emergence of institutions of this kind in different countries. The initial choice of FGV was due to the fact that it was carrying out important activities in the area of bibliography and documentation.</p>

<p>At the time, the National Research Council (CNPq) was also being created, one of whose functions was to ""maintain relations with national and foreign institutions for the exchange of technical and scientific documentation"". Through a joint CNPq/FGV proposal, the Brazilian Institute of Bibliography and Documentation (IBBD) was created on 27 February 1954, by Decree of the President of the Republic No. 35,124, and became part of the CNPq's organisational structure.</p>

<p>The 1970s were marked by a reorganisation of science and technology activities in the country. The National Research Council was transformed into the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, expanding its power, transforming it into a foundation and linking it to the Planning Secretariat and the Presidency of the Republic. Like the CNPq, the IBBD underwent a transformation, including a change of name to the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (IBICT), with the publication of CNPq Executive Resolution 20/76. IBICT was then consolidated as the body that would coordinate S&T information activities in Brazil.</p>

<p>Since then, IBICT has also worked to promote the popularisation of scientific and technological information. Examples of this initiative are the ""Science at Five"" project, launched in 1987; a year later, the S&T Film Database; and, in 1993, the ""Appropriate Technologies Programme"".</p>

<p>Since 1975, IBICT has been acting as the National Centre of the ISSN Network, for assigning the international standard number to serial publications. From 1980, IBICT established itself as the Brazilian ISSN Centre and became the only member in Brazil to assign the ISSN code.</p>

<p>One of IBICT's first services, the National Collective Catalogue of Serial Publications (CCN), was created in 1954 by the then IBBD as a conventional card catalogue, providing information in person, by telephone or by correspondence. Since then, the service has kept pace with the evolution of technology, passing through the printed edition, microfiche and finally to its current electronic version.</p>

<p>The Bibliographic Commutation Programme (Comut), established by Ministerial Order 456 of 5 August 1980, is one of IBICT's traditional products, which makes it possible to obtain copies of technical scientific documents available in the collections of the main Brazilian libraries and international information services.</p>

<p>Today, IBICT is a reference in projects aimed at the movement for free access to knowledge. An example of this commitment is the Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (BDTD), launched in 2002, which uses the most modern open file technologies and integrates information systems for theses and dissertations from Brazilian teaching and research institutions. The BDBTD has a collection of more than 126,000 theses and dissertations from 90 educational institutions. This makes it the largest library of its kind in the world in terms of the number of records of theses and dissertations from a single country.</p>

<p>Also part of IBICT's recent history is the launch of CanalCiência, a portal for the dissemination of science and the popularisation of science, in 2002, which uses audiovisual media as a resource for including young people in the Information Society. It is worth noting that CanalCiência was nominated for the World Summit on the Information Society award as the best example of electronic content and creativity in this category.</p>

<p>In 2005, as well as improving its traditional services, IBICT expanded its activities to include other segments of society lacking organised information on the Web that were not yet part of its user community. To this end, it created the Social Inclusion Programme and began to use its expertise in organising, storing and disseminating information to support public policies aimed at the social field, particularly with regard to implementing direct actions in the field of information and digital learning.</p>","<li>1) Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (Ibict) <a href=""https://ror.org/006c42y96"" target=""_blank"">https://ror.org/006c42y96</a>

Around 20,000 organisations are members so that they can create identifiers for metadata records that describe and locate their research. The records describe articles, book chapters, preprints, grants, and all kinds of digital or even physical objects relating to scholarly and professional research. Crossref members share the records through Crossref so that they don’t have to duplicate the information for the thousands who consume and use it downstream throughout the global research ecosystem.</p>

<p>The focus here is on the part of the Crossref infrastructure that facilitates the open and accessible retrieval of these metadata records, numbering over 150 million today. </p>

<p>Anyone can access to use these records without restriction, either through our search tool, search.crossref.org, or our REST API, api.crossref.org. There are no fees to use the metadata, but people who really rely on it may sign up for Metadata 'Plus', which offers greater predictability and higher rate limits.</p>

<p>People retrieving Crossref metadata need it for all sorts of reasons, including metaresearch (researchers studying research itself, such as through bibliometric analyses), publishing trends (such as finding works from an individual author or reviewer), or incorporation into specific databases (such as for discovery and search or in subject-specific repositories), and many more detailed use cases.</p>",https://www.crossref.org,https://ror.org/02twcfp32,https://assets.crossref.org/logo/crossref-logo-200.svg,"New York, New York, United States of America","We envision a rich and reusable open network of relationships connecting research organizations, people, things, and actions; a scholarly record that the global community can build on forever, for the benefit of society.","Tools and services in all the categories listed tend to use Crossref metadata.

<li>Fedora 6.0 was released in June 2020 and represented the largest major rewrite of the core code since Fedora 4 was released in 2014. Fedora 6.0 saw the elimination of ModeShape as a backend, and the introduction of the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) as a preservation standard within the persistence layer. This change returned Fedora to its digital preservation-focused roots, giving users back the transparency and functionality they were used to from previous versions. Fedora 6.x adoption rates are steadily climbing, and feedback from users indicates it is robust and performant.

<li>In 2020, Fedora was awarded an IMLS Grant (Fedora Migration Paths & Tools: A Pilot Project) to support development of tooling and documentation to help users migrate from Fedora 3.x to Fedora 6.x. Fedora 3 is one of the most widely used versions of the software that exists, but it is end of life, and the continued reliance on this outdated software puts the security, functionality and reliability of those repositories at risk. The grant effort created a migration pathway to help navigate the migration process in an effort to protect the content contained within those repositories. Coupled with the tooling, a Migration Toolkit was published, providing step-by-step instructions, templates, user stories, and best practices gathered from the grant pilot partners. This toolkit is maintained on the Fedora wiki <a href=""https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/FF/Fedora+Migration+Paths+and+Tools"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

<li>Fedora has a globally installed user base and recently has taken action to ensure broader representation at decision-making levels of program governance. Through intentional outreach and engagement with partners and users outside of North America, the Fedora program has grown its global geographical representation on Governance, and non-North American members now make up nearly 30% of the group. Our continued work to connect with more diverse users has resulted in significant growth in our community communication channels with over 100 new members being added to these channels in the last year.

<p>Initially, its focus was on establishing agreements and policies related to federated access, standardized policies, interoperability standards, and a technology pilot.</p>

<p>In this context, LA Referencia emerged from the Cooperation Agreement signed in Buenos Aires in 2012. This agreement reflected the political determination to provide the scientific output of Latin America openly, emphasizing the regional public benefit of works financed with public funds.</p>

<p>Following the conclusion of the IDB project in 2013, the network transitioned into a permanent initiative sustained by the national authorities in Science and Technology across the region, with the backing of RedCLARA.

After the Second World War, the flow of information worldwide increased and the organization of scientific information became increasingly important for development. In this context, the newly created United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) sought to stimulate bibliographic organization worldwide. </p>

<p>In the early 1950s, UNESCO, the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) and the CNPq began preparations for the creation of a bibliographic center in Brazil with the aim of boosting national scientific and technological activities. Librarians Lydia Sambaquy and Jannice Monte-Mor visited the main libraries and documentation centers in Europe and the United States to look for organizational models. </p>

<p>In 1954, with the support of the Brazilian government, the Brazilian Institute of Librarianship and Documentation (IBBD) was created and set up in Rio de Janeiro, which became part of the CNPq's organizational structure. Among its objectives, the institute sought to promote bibliographic and documentation services, establish exchanges with international technical-scientific documentation institutions and develop training and further training courses in Library Science and Documentation.</p> 

<p>Its first president was Lydia Sambaquy, who was IBBD's director for 11 years. In 1956, IBBD started the Scientific Documentation Course. At the specialization level, the course was a pioneering postgraduate course in the field of bibliography and documentation in Brazil and Latin America, and opened up a new field of professional action. The institute sought to provide scientific and technological information to researchers who requested it and guided librarians from different regions of Brazil in providing scientific information services to the academic community. </p>

<p>""The founding of Ibict at that time was very important because there was a huge volume of information and it was dispersed and disorganized. The IBBD began to organize scientific knowledge by area and was fundamental to the scientific and technological development of that time. It helped Brazil to be seen as a country that was at the forefront of the field, at the forefront of this issue. And vanguardism became the keynote of Ibict,"" says Cecília Leite.  </p>

<p>Soon the IBDD would also stand out for its innovation. The first copying machine from Xerox do Brasil, a company founded in 1965, was installed at the IBBD in December 1966. In 1968, the IBBD was the first body in Latin America to have automated information systems, as well as automating its traditional services. In that year, the institute launched the first Brazilian Bibliography formed by an automated process. For some historical thinkers in the field of information in Brazil, this event was a founding milestone of Information Science in the country.</p>

<p>The 1970s were marked by a reorganization of science and technology activities in the country, with the strengthening of public policies for scientific and technological development. In the field of information, the advent of computers and electronics changed paradigms and opened up new possibilities. </p>

<p>In 1970, librarians Célia Ribeiro Zaher and Hagar Espanha Gomes, then president and vice-president of IBBD, created the first Master's course in Information Science in South America, in an agreement with the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), opening doors to the field of information science studies and the training of professionals in the area. Two years later, the IBBD created the journal Ciência da Informação, the first scientific journal in the field in Brazil.  </p>

<p>In 1976, the IBBD was renamed Ibict and in 1980, the institute moved its headquarters from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília. In 1985, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT) was created and in 2000, Ibict became subordinate to the ministry. Ibict was then consolidated as the body that would coordinate science and technology information activities in Brazil, with services aimed at the academic community, the research sector, the productive sector and the government.</p>",Instituto Brasileiro de Informação em Ciência e Tecnologia (Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology) (Ibict),Instituto Brasileiro de Informação em Ciência e Tecnologia (Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology) (Ibict),,3,Program service revenue,1,,5,Actual system proven in operational environment,1,Actively maintained,,"<a href=""https://github.com/lareferencia"" target=""_blank"">LA Referencia Platform</a>",NULL,https://github.com/lareferencia/lareferencia-oai-pmh/blob/master/LICENSE,,4,Implemented/available,https://oasisbr.ibict.br/vufind/swagger-ui/,2,Considering,NULL,TRUE,0,0,0,0,100000,0,0,0,"<p>The Brazilian Portal of Publications and Scientific Data in Open Access (Oasisbr) is an initiative of the Instituto Brasileiro de Informação em Ciência e Tecnologia (IBICT), a national information body and research unit of the Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação (MCTI).

<p>Similar to how open access research is research that has been licensed to be freely shared, read, cited and more, without restrictions or fees, FOSS is licensed to be freely shared, installed, and modified. More specifically, PKP employs the General Public License V3 for its FOSS and recommends that those using the software apply a CC BY 4.0 license to their open access publications.</p>

<p>The congruence in spirit and license that PKP has achieved between FOSS and open access has worked well in assisting the academic community in taking charge of scholarly publishing in the digital era. The resulting software has led to publishers, librarians, and scholars publishing millions of peer-reviewed articles and books around the world. It has also given rise to a new generation of FOSS preprint servers.</p>

<p>Building FOSS platforms leads to a distributed model of local installations that can develop regional technical capacities on a global scale. It encourages code contributions from among users, especially in the form of FOSS plugins for the platforms. It also facilitates users sharing translations of the software. PKP systems operate in more than 30 languages, while publishing research in 60 languages. In this way, FOSS reflects a spirit of cooperation and collaboration that underlies the spread of a more open science.</p>

<p>Open source + open access is also giving rise to more equitable forms of scholarly publishing. The best example of this is the OA diamond journal phenomenon, in which neither authors nor readers are charged for open access to the journal’s content. In 2021, the OA Diamond Journals Study led by Arianna Bercerril found that 60 percent of these publishing diamonds are using OJS, while they estimate that there may be as many as 29,000 OA diamond journals. If anything, this may be an undercount, given that in 2021 over 30,000 journals were found to be using OJS, almost entirely on diamond principles.</p>

<p>All in all, open source + open access enables PKP to bring a refreshing and expanding openness to scholarly communication infrastructure on a global scale.</p>","PKP is ORCID certified; participates in the SCOSS program; OJS journals provide a large percentage of all journals in the DOAJ; as part of its Coalition Publica partnership, PKP is recognized and funded by the Canadian government as a “Major Science Initiative”.",2,Formal,http://www.sfu.ca/policies/gazette/board.html,2,Multi-board governance,2,Fiscal sponsorship (academic institution),27,"PKP was founded in 1998 by John Willinsky, then a professor in the Faculty of Education at the University of British Columbia.

<p>Historically the applications are monolithic and use a Model-View-Controller pattern within a custom framework first introduced with OJS 2.0 in 2005. Smarty was used for templating and ADODB is used for database abstraction (primarily supporting PostgreSQL and MySQL).</p>

<p>OJS 3.0 (first released in 2016) began introducing separation between the front end and back end as front-end Javascript and JSON became popular.</p>

<p>Initially the core applications (variously OJS, OHS, OCS, and later OMP and OPS) were independently maintained but forking of common concerns was an early issue, leading to the development of a common library (“pkp-lib”, the PKP Web Application Library). This has been further refined into a simultaneous release process for all current applications.</p>

<p>Beginning with OJS/OMP 3.2 (first released in 2020), the applications adopted VueJS and expanded the capabilities of the API by driving API development from the front end.</p>

<p>Beginning with OJS/OMP 3.3 (first released in 2021), the custom back-end stack is being gradually replaced with Laravel-based tools, including the database abstraction layer, event management, and other key tools. This transformation will continue over several major releases.</p>

<p>This pattern of rolling maintenance allows a modestly sized development team to continue regular stable releases without building technical debt that will lead to a large-scale rewrite of the software.</p>

The project was global in scope, and was designed to change the face of scientific publishing and scholarly communication, since it aimed to publish open bibliographic citation information in RDF and to make citation links as easy to traverse as Web links. The main deliverable of the project, among several outcomes, was the release of an open repository of scholarly citation data 3 described using the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies, and named the OpenCitations Corpus (OCC), which was initially populated with the citations from journal articles within the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central. At the end of 2015, after David Shotton had become a member of the Oxford e-Research Centre at the University of Oxford, Silvio Peroni of the University of Bologna joined OpenCitations as co-director and technical manager, with the aim of setting up a new instantiation of the Corpus based on a new metadata schema and employing several new technologies to automate the ingestion of fresh citation metadata from authoritative sources. Silvio Peroni is now a member of the Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies at the University of Bologna, and the current instantiation of the OCC is hosted by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Bologna. Since the beginning of July 2016 OCC has been ingesting, processing and publishing reference lists of scholarly papers available in Europe PubMed Central. Additional metadata for these citations are obtained from Crossref and (for authors) ORCID. In 2017, OpenCitations was awarded of a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for The OpenCitations Enhancement Project. The funding was used to improve the hardware and software infrastructure for handling the data and hosting all the services OpenCitations makes available. During this period, OpenCitations has developed a number of citation indexes using the data openly available in third-party bibliographic databases. The first and largest of these is COCI, the OpenCitations Index of Crossref open DOI-to-DOI citations. In 2019, OpenCitations wa awarded of another grant from the Wellcome Trust for the Open Biomedical Citations in Context Corpus project. The aim of this project is to create a new dataset containing data for each individual in-text reference, making it possible to distinguish references that are cited only once from those that are cited multiple times, to see which references are cited together (e.g. in the same sentence), to determine in which section of the article references are cited (e.g. Introduction, Methods), and, potentially, to retrieve the function of the citation. Recently, at the end of 2019, OpenCitations has been selected by the Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services (SCOSS) for their second round of crowd-funding support. They stated that OpenCitations aligns well with open science goals and is an innovative service - considering that open citation data are important to the community since they have the potential to support change in research assessment, and if successful could be a game changer by challenging established proprietary citation services. Starting in January 2020, SCOSS will invite research organizations, scholarly institutions and funders of all sizes throughout the world to contribute financially in proportion to their size and ability to sustain OpenCitations' operations over the next three years as it transitions into a global scholarly infrastructure organization with a secure financial footing. OpenCitations is currently managed by the Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata, an independent research centre within the University of Bologna. The Research Centre has an International Board drawn from leaders within the main bibliographic stakeholder communities of relevance (librarians, bibliometricians, academics, data service providers, etc.) who have shown past solid commitment to open scholarship. The statutes of the Research Centre will ensure that OpenCitations' original aim of free provision of open bibliographic and citation data, services and software is maintained, and that OpenCitations as an organization cannot in future be taken over or controlled by commercial interests, nor become involved in political, regulatory, legislative or financial lobbying of any kind.","Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata, University of Bologna","University of Oxford, University of Bologna","OpenCitations main competitors are Google Scholar, Scopus, Dimensions, OpenAlex, Web of Science, the NIH Open Citations Collection, CiteSeerX, OpenAIRE.",1,Contributions,NULL,,5,Actual system proven in operational environment,1,Actively maintained,"RDF, Python, Blazegraph, Qlever, lighttpd, Linux Debian, web.py","Figshare, Internet Archive, GitHub, OpenAIRE, RISIS, EOSC",NULL,The text of the web pages that comprise the OpenCitations web site is made freely available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.
