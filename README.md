# README

[IOI](https://investinopen.org) Infra Finder.

## Setting up

Ensure you have docker, docker-compose, and docker-sync (`gem install docker-sync`) installed.

Though credentials are not extensively used on this project yet, copy the master key from "Infra Finder master.key"
in 1Password and put it in place, `pbpaste > config/master.key`

`docker-sync` must always be running in order to have changes persist between your host and the docker container.

```bash
docker-sync start

# Now launch / build the containers.
docker-compose up -d
```

Look at `docker-compose ps` to make sure everything gets into a running state before proceeding.

### Minio

Minio is used to simulate S3 in development. On your **host** machine, run the following script:

```bash
docker/minio/configure.sh
```

It will do what needs to be done in the docker container.

### Setting up the database

On your **host** machine, run the following:

```bash
docker/ensure_seeds.sh
```

This will take a little time. Errors about file formats and VIPS can be ignoredâ€”the data has some messy image URLs. The import will proceed regardless.

### Setting up your admin account

You can launch a console inside the docker environment via `bin/console`. To make a new user for dev, launch one and:

```ruby
user = InfraFinder::Container["testing.add_super_admin"].("youremail@castironcoding.com", "Your Name").value!;
```

The randomly-generated password will get printed to the console. You can then sign in by going to [the admin section](http://localhost:6856/admin).

## Local Usage

### Accessing the local site

The frontend is available at [http://localhost:6856](http://localhost:6856).

### Accessing Mailcatcher

All mail sent in a local environment is sent to the `mailcatcher` container.

You can browse those messages here: [http://localhost:6857/](http://localhost:6857/).

### Changing ruby gems

Modify the Gemfile and run `docker-compose exec web bundle` as needed.

### Changing node.js packages

Run `docker-compose exec web yarn add PACKAGEHERE`.

**Note**: Do not run yarn on your local machine. It needs to happen in Docker. `node_modules` is not and cannot be shared between the two environments.

## Adding more view components

To add a view component, use the Rails generator. From your local machine:

```bash
docker-compose exec web bin/rails g component ComponentName --stimulus
```

The `ComponentName` should be something like `FooBar` in pascal case, and it will generate a component named `FooBarComponent` with its associated sidecar directory `app/components/foo_bar_component`. The `--stimulus` option is necessary to make sure that the generated HTML template is wired up to the component's specific Stimulus controller correctly. After you've done that, you can generate a colocated CSS file and have it automatically be included in the CSS manifest by running the following:

```bash
docker-compose exec web bin/rails g view_component:assets:regenerate
```
